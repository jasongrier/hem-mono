      <p>
        Midst's journal will always be free to the public.<br />

        We hope to continue to grow and to share diverse new work from contemporary writers, serving as a growing library of poetry-as-process. We currently have two "staff" members (Annelyse Gelman and Jason Gillis-Grier), both volunteers, and each contributor is currently paid $50. Midst's financial future is uncertain, but we believe transparency is important to build a healthy, thriving literary community where people trust each other. We hope you'll consider a one-time or monthly donation to help us continue our work!<br />

        All contributions directly support Midst's future, including paying for commissions, web hosting, design, app development, and more.<br />

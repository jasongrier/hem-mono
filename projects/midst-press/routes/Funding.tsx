          Midst's journal will always be free to the public.
        </p>

        <p>
          We hope to continue to grow and to regularly share diverse new work from contemporary writers, serving as a growing library of poetry-as-process. We currently have two "staff" members (Annelyse Gelman and Jason Gillis-Grier), both volunteers, and each contributor is currently paid $50. These commission fees are pulled from runner-up earnings from UT Austin's Keene Prize and from Midst's <a href="http://www.patreon.com/midstpoetry">patrons</a>. As Midst evolves, we'll continue to share up-to-date information on funding here. We believe transparency like this is important to build a healthy, thriving literary community where people trust each other.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're excited about what we're building here, we hope you'll consider a one-time or monthly donation to help us continue our work!
        </p>

        <p>
          All contributions directly support Midst's future, including paying for commissions, web hosting, design, app development, and more.

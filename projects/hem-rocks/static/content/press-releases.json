The early 2000's were the swingin' glitch years, when clicking, skipping, beat-repeat and buffer-delay seeped into every ontological stratum of music-making.\n\nBut it wasn't just flashy winks teased into indie pop-dance, facile quasi-classical crossover, and bookish sound art. Glitch was a grand, sweeping sea-change in how people listened to recorded music. The idea that the act of editing was now elemental, unconcealed; that seems to be the legacy of experimental electronica's golden years.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all seemed to lie this curious little album by Ekkehard Ehlers, made of nothing more nor less than mashups of two of the previous century's musical sea-changers, Arnold Schönberg and Charles Ives. A high concept, even for haughty times. Not exactly the stuff of poetical dreams, right?\n\nBut in the decade to follow, Ehlers would become well-known for balancing the heart precariously upon the intellectual sword. In his follow-up to Betrieb, the \"Ekkehard Ehlers Plays\" series, the works of Cornelius Cardew and Albert Ayler were brought to bear upon a new tradition that had yet to figure out how it felt about feeling. While before it, as any proper first album should, Betrieb could have no better stated this mission of pitting concept against intuition. To this day, Betrieb continues to articulate the epistemology of its era, as much as it offers timeless auditory delights.\n\nHEM's 24bit remaster represents a significant update to the original sound. The original masters were transferred to 1/2\" tape, and then treated to a remarkable journey through hand-wound patch cables, bespoke acoustics, and humming transistors.\n\nEhlers' music not only stands up to the analog treatment, it shines: Clicks and pops have become fuzzy glowing points of starlight, while once-foggy atmospherics have become layered, multidimensional skeins of strings and smoke.\n\nBetrieb was once the thinking-person's feeling-music (or the feeling-person's thinking-music). But it is now, simply, a transportive listening experience.\n","as":"f47f4800-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"betrieb.jpg","aw":"7","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Ekkehard Ehlers — April 1, 2013","bg":"betrieb-ekkehard-ehlers-press-release","bi":", done-for-now","bj":"Betrieb Press Release"},{"bl":"c4617685-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Using personal deconstructions of amateur soul music as a skeleton, Grier fleshed out nods to Kosmiche, 70′s Eno, Janet Jackson and Jodeci, Terry Riley, drone music, renaissance organ music, and medieval composers like Petrus de Cruce and Josquin des Prez.","ah":"press-releases","ai":"April 2012","aj":"***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nClouds: Jason Grier\n\n***Formats***: Streaming/Digital/2xCD/2xLP (with download card)<br>\n***Release Date***: June 19, 2012<br>\n***Cat.

Mad Criminale\n\n***About Clouds***\n\nClouds is a little novella of an album; a sphinx-like meditation on fate, circumstance and the oddities of being a perpetual traveller. Fittingly, it was recorded in three years and three cities; between 2009 and 2011 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Berlin. Grier carried the drafts around like a travelogue, and the resulting compositions read like an accumulation of curiously juxtaposed sounds and notes-to-self about the fickle nature of fate.\n\nUsing personal deconstructions of amateur soul music as a skeleton, Grier fleshed out nods to Kosmiche, 70′s Eno, Janet Jackson and Jodeci, Terry Riley, drone music, renaissance organ music, and medieval composers like Petrus de Cruce and Josquin des Prez. He first crafted an original set of grooves, then deleted beats and notes until just-so-little of the original syncopation could be felt. In the resulting void, he sought out hovering musicologies emerging like clouds in tension with nothingness.\n\nIn \"Karma\", the gorgeously sparse duet with Julia Holter, the void is filled by one of the album's many field recordings, sourced from a badly scratched \"soothing sounds of nature\" record found in a San Francisco thrift store. The vinyl hiss creates a double-irony, but more importantly serves as a kind of \"springtime mist\" where the tensions nothing/ something, sure/ unsure, and I-love-you/ I-love-you-not come in and out of focus. Grier composed the vocals following a medieval technique where a single melody is traded between performers. The result is a love poem that may or may not belong to the same heart, that may be spoken by indifferent voices, or by two people of one mind.\n\nContrast this to the title track, where bubbling, fizzing energy propels a sardonic exchange between a hapless dreamer (Grier) and a hip stoner (portrayed by Lucrecia Dalt). The dreamer can never convince the stoner that doing what comes natural is extraordinary. But ultimately, both agree \"that all you really ever need is in the sky\" —be it a sky filled with dreams or smoke.\n\nBetween \"Karma\" and \"Clouds\", sits ecclesiastical funk ballad, \"The Rules\". Here Grier claims that fate isn't our maker; it's just a hitchhiker riding our lives to some far off place. The song's A-B-A structure, with a deadpan verse repeat after 4 minutes of tantric buildup, echoes its theme of eternal return. This probably best sums up the movement of Clouds. We get nervous peering at the void (which is always the true form of \"what comes next\") even though we're certain to encounter something familiar. You keep meeting the same souls over and over again. And it's quite nice.\n","as":"f47f9620-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"clouds.jpg","aw":"11","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Jason Grier – June 19, 2012","bg":"clouds-jason-grier-press-release","bi":", done-for-now","bj":"Clouds Press Release"},{"bl":"c4610154-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"With her sophomore full-length, Lucrecia Dalt leaps into a surrealist landscape with stunning abandon, eschewing the comparatively safe tropes and song structures of her previous work.

Batholith\n\n***About Commotus***\n\nToday, we seem to have two branches in the school of experimental pop. One branch privileges object-hood, richness of surface, and mass-hallucinatory quotation. The other (much less celebrated) branch seeks to recapture authenticity in the form of a highly personal hallucination of music history.\n\nWith her sophomore full-length, Lucrecia Dalt follows the latter branch as far as it seems to go. She leaps into a surrealist landscape with stunning abandon, eschewing the comparatively safe tropes and song structures of her previous work. And she charts a surprisingly inventive and rewarding territory in the process. Much as it is with her newfound contemporaries at HEM Berlin, for Dalt, solitude and assemblage (of sound, genre, musicology, technique) is an exploratory zone steered toward the inner universe. To follow the music, one must be prepared to make this trip as real as sound itself.\n\nThemes of agitation and disturbance, cumulative, impending and scalable, propel Commotus, and create a framework for understanding its emotional spectra. The music lives in the contradiction between having time to reflect on the inevitable, and the irrevocability of its outcome. \n\nDalt, who is a civil engineer with a specialty in geotechnics, knows that motion on a geologic time scale can be the most poignant analogy to the interminable struggle between self-awareness and sea change.\n\nThe album opens with a Saltación. An English speaker's mind might mistake a bit of wordplay here, as if this opening statement were a \"salutation\". It seems like a proper greeting enough, with a ceremonious gong resounding behind a chorus of liquid angels and transistor-organ castanets. In fact, Saltación is a geological process that occurs within sand dust, a repeated movement that ultimately accumulates to enormous scale. It is with this timeless notion of the enormity of change that Dalt greets us.\n\nEscopolamina is a drug that erases memory temporarily. It is commonly used in Dalt's birth country, Colombia, to steal things on the streets. Escopolamina causes the victim to lose total will for minutes so as to give their belongings up voluntarily. The song's sneaky tango metre creeps over a metronomic click-track, as if to mock the experience of lost time.\n\nIn Turmoil, she reveals her new approach to music as well as any other track. She intones \"long, lasting, filthy, seeking...\" at once mantra-like and languid. Here she shows that she is as unafraid to approach ambivalent concepts as she is dramatic tension. She says, \"I've been doing deals with the devil, you should have been aware of all this fire.\" Forestalling the call's response until Esplendor, four tracks later, she proclaims \"Well you see, no, you don't see, your unforgivable sins don't allow you to see my splendor \"mi splendor\", but somehow in my fostered idiocy, I am born, you know me, well, you knew me well! You knew me well until today.\"\n\nIn Batholith, it all comes to a head: \"Let me brake your ecstasy my love, you forgot that I don't obey to your linear truth. You forgot that I have the felsic spring powers, surprise surprise, I'll disrupt your narrative and alter your flattened landscape, sorry about that.\" The love story of a batholith spring that reshapes our predictable ground. Or the Deleuzean thought of geological time: Something can spring from the depths and change our narratives, our perception of reality and we are somehow obliged to continue with this new appearing, deal with it, or suffer from it.\n\nDalt has established herself as a solo performer, building songs live and in recordings using pedals, laptop, and loops. So it's all the more surprising that, throughout Commotus, she works with an enormous, and enormously subtle, sound palette, almost completely triggered from solo bass. (Two notable exceptions being guest appearances from Luke Sutherland and Julia Holter.) \n\nSome of these sounds are as concrete as a timpani shot, or the snap of an analog rhythm box. But the majority of sounds exist in a nether-world between evocation and pure abstraction. This is rife terrain for self-expression, and dramatic tension, with a result made all the more poignant because she's playing alone. In Commotus, you can hear every sound event becoming the curled-up dimensions of a richly personal experience.\n","as":"f47fbd30-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"commotus.jpg","aw":"12","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Lucrecia Dalt — June 19, 2012","bg":"commotus-lucrecia-dalt-press-release","bi":", done-for-now","bj":"Commotus Press Release"},{"bl":"c4614f71-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"\"Demonstration Disc\" is, ostensibly, a new album by Human Ear Music creator Jason Grier; \nequally  so,  it’s  a  quickstart  guide  to  the  sonic  offerings  in  an  open-sourced  collection  of \nsamples and generative music tools.","ah":"press-releases","ai":"August 2017","aj":"\n\n***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nJason Grier: Demonstration Disc\n\n***Formats***: Streaming/Digital (with 1.39 Gb Sound Library)<br>\n***Release Date***: October 6, 2017<br>\n***Cat.

Loud, decadent, irreverent, and cinematic, \"Demonstration Disc\" sounds like mashing down all the preset buttons on your sparkling-new, cosmic-avant-garde monster synth, with delectable aplomb.\n\nThe track titles, simply numbers 1 thru 10, wink at the idea that this is a generic test suite, but also belie the thematic and political undertones of the album, composed largely in Berlin and Amsterdam, in November 2016, on the brink of, and during the aftermath of the US presidential elections.\n\nSounds range from the lushly psychoacoustic –hundreds of guitar harmonics woven together into gossamer threads, panoramic field recordings of Berlin’s raucous New Year’s Eve fireworks– to the non-cochlear; for example, outtakes, gaffes, and editing remnants preserved as artifacts of artistic labor; as well as rips of Facebook video feeds of mass-protests following the US election of Donald Trump, so mangled by a slow NY–Berlin internet connection as to converge upon what is stereotypically diagnosed as “noise music“. But this is neither distinctly noise, nor music as such, even in its deployment at the end of the album’s penultimate track.\n\nMusically, Demonstration Disc furthers the approach taken by Grier on 2013’s \"Unbekannte\", described as \"a series of mysterious short films\", by Julia Holter —who makes a cameo appearance on track 6, whistling a sliced-up <i>Au Clair de la Lune</i>. Unlike \"Unbekannte\", which was largely hand-edited, Grier’s sound-monoliths on Demonstration Disc are machine-tooled by his often unpredictable \"generative playback engine\", a sample-dot sprayer which he jokingly named \"Seurat MIDI\".\n\nThe resulting assemblies of sound are more complex and dense, sprawling for their relatively small running times, and almost illegibly detailed at times. For example, track 6’s coruscated vault of sound consists of sleigh bells, squiggly noise-reduction artifacts, and high notes from a 150-year old, wood-rotted piano Grier discovered in a Tuscan villa.\n\nThe album is, nonetheless, part of a larger project which includes the \"open-sourcing\" of Grier’s sound library, the mainstay of his long-duration performances since 2013, comprising more than 1800 audio samples, plus the Seurat MIDI engine. Not only are the sounds and the tools freely available, Grier even provides tutorials and has planned expansion packs, making this act of framework development into the larger artwork itself.\n","as":"f4800b50-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"demonstration-disc.jpg","aw":"2","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Jason Grier — October 6, 2017","bg":"demonstration-disc-jason-grier-press-release","bi":"past, releases, done-for-now","bj":"Demonstration Disc Press Release","bk":"Demon&shy;stration Disc Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612865-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Haunted Graffiti wasn’t the first time a bedroom-cloistered Ariel Pink revolutionized his own sound and persona by taking to the stage with a band.

The 14 songs were recorded and produced by Gary in his San Diego apartment between 2004 and 2007. \n\nThroughout, he croons gently and frankly over a collection of effortless pop, reminiscent of a thousand lounge gigs. Never have Gary’s imaginary girlfriends been so numerous and charismatic. They are shuffled around in a number of combinations, scenes and poses, sometimes confronting each other, traveling in wooded dreams, or warming up their mental homes. Their names are blurted out like elements of an abstracted lexicon, and the effect is strangely introspective.\n","as":"f480f5b0-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"lisa-wants-to-talk-to-you.jpg","aw":"14","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Gary Wilson — November 24, 2008","bg":"lisa-wants-to-talk-to-you-gary-wilson-press-release","bj":"Lisa Wants To Talk To You Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612863-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"A glimpse into Julia Holter's experimental pop series \"Translations\".","ah":"press-releases","ai":"April 2014","aj":"***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nJulia Holter: Maria\n\n***Formats***: Streaming/Digital/7\" Vinyl (with download card)<br>\n***Release Date***: June 3, 2014<br>\n***Cat.

Instantly it was a black night; rain..._<br>\n— _Walter Benjamin, dream transcription from \"Das Buch der Träume\"_</small>\n\nIf not by accelerating global crises and surreal election cycles in the west, late-2016 may have been marked, historically, as the moment of \"peak TV\", when binge-watching immersive Netflix offerings for hours on end produced the opioid mindstate of a waking dream _en masse_.\n\nIn her solo debut, Copenhagen’s Line Gøttsche Dyrholm —violinist, CalArts MFA student, and alumna of Danish electronic popband Belle Ville— furnishes a nearly perfect anti-partner to our streaming video panem et circenses. Omonia’s 28 minutes of delicate piano and bare vocals feels immersive and epic, fractured and dreamlike, yet anything but soporific.\n\nGøttsche’s voice guides us gracefully and all-too-swiftly through a series of disjointed fin-du-siècle set pieces, her narration smoothing out the incongruities —partial staircases to nowhere, french doors opening onto ivy-draped brick walls, an asymptotic woodland twilight in which the sun never quite sets— both sketching out and soundtracking a kind of \"Last Year at Marienbad\" world. Tempered flourishes of classical and jazz instruments accompany her drifting piano sonorities, which sound at times straight from the late-romantic playbook (Satie, Debussy, and the final works of Franz Liszt come to mind). On repeated listens, however, the vocal lines prove to be a brittle leader, seemingly stitched together from some long-lost narrative thread, the paeans and barbs of an inflationary love, and the bitter arc toward its chauvinistic decline: A shadow-play of heroism, computerized bodies and ameliorating houseplants. Over the course of Omonia’s five sections, allusions and metonymies recur and efface each other’s meanings; fragile sentence fragments coalesce and diverge again.\n\nThe performativity of words and decadent asceticism is decisive, and timely. Gøttsche’s low-tech invocation of cognitive dissonance, heightened sensitivity, and circular memory finds itself squarely in the midst of our amnesiac age of digital alienation and artificial dreams. But Omonia comes across as neither a coy sarcasm nor a trenchant critique, rather, something quite original and strange; sincere and surreal in equal measure.\n","as":"f4816ae0-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"omonia.jpg","aw":"3","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Line Gøttsche — November 25, 2016","bg":"omonia-line-gottsche-press-release","bi":"past, releases, done-for-now","bj":"Omonia Press Release"},{"bl":"c4614f74-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"The tracks selected for _Scared Famous_ were all recorded at a key moment in Pink's recording adventure, dating back to, or immediately following the recordings on \"House Arrest.\"","ah":"press-releases","ai":"August 2017","aj":"***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nAriel Pink's Haunted Graffiti: Scared Famous\n\n***Formats***: CD-R<br>\n***Release Date***: August 21, 2007<br>\n***Cat.

The tracks selected for _Scared Famous_ were all recorded at a key moment in Pink's recording adventure, dating back to, or immediately following the recordings on \"House Arrest.\"\n\nSelected from a self-made double-album in vague circulation a few years ago, the recordings on _Scared Famous_ stand out for being worth more than a listen. Pink's songwriting powers seems to have taken a leap, stealing the show from his trademark tape-texture aesthetics and begging for appreciation in their own right.\n\nFor the first time in his grand recording adventure, you hear Ariel Pink's music evoking a bygone era, not because of the fuzz and hiss of delapidated tape, but because you just can't believe anybody can write songs like this anymore.\n\nAppropriately then, this release comes just as Ariel has begun playing out with a six piece band consisting of local Los Angeles musicians, leaving his karaoke-tape days behind.\n","as":"f48191f0-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"scared-famous.jpg","aw":"15","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bf":"Ariel Pink — August 21, 2007","bg":"scared-famous-ariel-pink-press-release","bi":", done-for-now","bj":"Scared Famous Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612864-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Lucrecia Dalt treats listeners to a perilously brief, intricately conceived meditation.

Mirage\n\n***I: An Invitation to Divide***\n\nSyzygy begins with a simple provocation enough: \"Are you in a hurry?\" But if Lucrecia Dalt intends to provoke, then her invitation leads to a radically unexpected denouement. For Dalt does, indeed, lead us. But where she leads us is to a kind of Ursprung of beautiful distress. Syzygy is a notion which Dalt poetically amplifies by giving emotional depth to the astrophysical concept of a point of conjunction and opposition. No place is this, and no whole thing can exist here. In contrast to her contemporaries, Dalt's second opus sees her become more the Charon than the chanteuse, reminding us that complicatedness, dialectic, and radical alterity are what really forged the axle of creation. For Dalt, Syzygy is a state of eternal oscillation that effervesces from the sand and levitates like a mirage.\n\nSyzygy is also an aftermath (maybe the scene following the ineluctable march of the cloud of dust that loomed on the cover of last year's Commotus); an infernal aporia filled with syntactic ambiguity and indeterminable potential. And Syzygy, indeed, plays up that previous album's game of getting you right on Dalt's level; of having to learn her aesthetic language before you can even ask what's her statement. But unlike Commotus, which required you to adjust your eyes to subtle contrasts of scale and temporality in order to wink at the portentousness of it all, Syzygy strikes quickly, like an arrow shot into the night of Dalt's perceptual domain.\n\n***II: The Devil's Staircase***\n\nEvery sound on Syzygy is a trace in darkness. Dalt has refined her palette with microscopic acuity, made it glimmer with hidden tension and uncertainty, and layered it with bristling moments of surrealism and tragicomic suspense. The sounds of Syzygy cling so closely to their ideologic roots that it could well be the quintessential thought-forms album: Rapid-pulse arpeggios fluttering on the edge between beautiful texture and unhinged counterpoint. Deep, compelling drones flowing onward like a slow river through candlelight. Unbearably sharp prickles and ungrounded loops springing up like uncertain stars, or sparks not yet to fuse into higher being. It's hard not to make a comparison to the zoo of elementary particles, or a space age sound library; Except the album advances forward with such inexorable cohesiveness that its brevity comes as the most electric shock of all.\n\nIn this time, Syzygy treats the listener to an intense —almost Webernian— series of micro-climaxes that ratchet you up a devil's staircase. You climb through tension after tension, before falling deep into drone and/or punch-drunk reverie. And the point of entry is just as jagged: After the relatively sanguine trip of _Glossolalia_ —with its theme of senseless language and un-becoming serving as an oddly beguiling welcome— we are dropped straight into the density of _Inframince_, a bass-on-bass counterpoint of oscillator and 808 with vocals skipping randomly between Spanish, Catalan and English. This striking piece is, in fact, a setting of Duchamp's notion of our most undefined moments, like the infinitessimal airspace between two bodies locked in embrace, the warmth remaining in a chair when the sitter has long vanished, or the unthinkably thin region between a levitating mirage and the ground. After _Inframince_'s mounting climax —in which Dalt splits herself quite literally in three, so that she can ricochet around the stereo field like a deleterious phantom— we are left with nowhere to go but the weary pastorale of sepia-toned finger-plucking, drifting Kubrickian in deoxygenated space.\n\nThe move is repeated with _Vitti_. _Syzygy_'s fractured heart goes here at 600bpm, an arpeggiated dervish that simply has nowhere to rest. Dalt's would-be wail is squelched by some kind of tornado leaving her voice crushed and hushed, tonally and ideologically rootless, and finally, provoked to some catatonic reverie. And again, we are put back down deep, in a track ironically titled _Levedad_, which perfectly expresses Calvino's paradoxical celebration of lightness in the face of inconsolable weight... Syzygy continues in this pattern to its conclusion. But let's leave it to you to follow on your own.\n\n***III: The Lightness of Weight***\n\nThe fact that Dalt demands such a thorough transformation of your sense of time and texture in just 32 minutes is a testament to her production skills, as much as to the edgy Barcelona twilight in which the album was composed. For two months straight, Dalt worked alone in a restless flat, with little measure of time or sleep, suspended, as she was, in the magnetic field of the Barcelona Metro. (The magnetic field was so strong her electric bass would produce little more than intense buzzing; one practical reason for Syzygy's stylistic switch to synthesiser drones and anxiety-fraught arpeggios.) In this claustrophobia, she filled her endless twilight with the company of 20th century film ghosts. Classics by Clouzot, Godard, Antonioni, and Bergman played on a video projector, straight through the recording process. Dalt would allow the film's sudden changes of mood and tempo to push the music in new directions, as if these cinematic moments were simply stems in the mix.\n\nBut for this reason, Syzygy still advances by means of surprise and aesthetic delight. A purely abstract musical framing of her subject might result in a difficult listen, whereas Dalt offers up whirring, purring, squealing, episodic timbres that are fundamentally filmic.\n\n***IV: Inferno***\n\nIt is, in fact, Syzygy's compressed format that belies the album's multidimensionality; its fabric of conjunction/opposition invades the narrow space between medium and signification. The lyric sheet is populated (or de-populated, destabilized) by seemingly incongruous quotations and scrambled notations: Sudden changes of language. Distorted re-arrangements of Benjamin's powerful critique of alienation. Peter J. Carroll's politicized defense of schizophrenia. Calvino's touching defense of happiness. A line from a Spanish government email confirming Dalt's change of citizenship.\n\nThis gives the listener not just a read-along to the vocal tracks, but a hidden textual dimension. This conjunction/opposition is what makes Dalt's second opus its own kind of masterpiece, realized as it is, not in the listening space in which the music is consumed, but in some archetypal dimension.\n\nAn inferno in which Dalt's Syzygy is eternally occurring.","as":"f481b900-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"syzygy.jpg","aw":"5","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Lucrecia Dalt — October 15, 2013","bg":"syzygy-lucrecia-dalt-press-release","bi":", done-for-now","bj":"Syzygy Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612862-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"An absorbing look at Ariel Rosenberg's early \"musique concrète\" epic.","ah":"press-releases","ai":"April 2013","aj":"***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nThrash & Burn: Ariel Pink\n\n***Formats***: Streaming/Digital/2xCD/2xLP (with download card)<br>\n***Release Date***: April 1, 2013<br>\n***Cat.

Much further downstream, a giant wall of light scaffolding fades into view. That is destiny's orphan multiverse inhabiting a single frame in its infancy. In time, we would transcend it. From where we stand our footsteps recede and fade into the darkness. But our beginnings are not lost; for someone standing off and above our horizon, in a human ear much more young, the secret of our coming of age shall be preserved revealed and discovered yet once again....\"<br>—Ariel Pink, November 2012_</small>\n\nThrash and Burn dates from a time when Ariel Rosenberg, then a few years from turning \"Pink\", first proclaimed himself a \"20th Century Composer\", without a trace of irony in his voice. Appropriately, this early work takes the form of a musique concrète epic forged from Rosenberg's late-90's faux-primitif, garage-punk, and tape-loop experiments.\n\nAt 94 minutes and 36 tracks, Thrash and Burn displays the symphonic ambitions of his genre-devouring pop saga, Haunted Graffiti, but with little in the way of fastidious album-oriented constructions. Rather, Thrash and Burn is a free-form tape ramble that uses gauzy atmospherics to strike up a wicked dialogue with the likes of Rosenberg's non-pop influences, like Iannis Xenakis, Pierre Schaeffer and Luc Ferrari.\n\nThrash and Burn was discovered in 2005, in an ankle-deep pile of cracked cassettes and scratched CD-R's in Rosenberg's Beverly Hills flat. After an initial reconstruction attempt, Thrash and Burn became a 4-cassette box set for the inaugural release of Human Ear Music, in 2006.\n\nThrash and Burn was remastered in September 2012 in Berlin, Germany. The final master was brought up to 24 bit resolution, dynamically and tonally balanced.\n","as":"f481e010-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"thrash-burn.jpg","aw":"10","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bf":"Ariel Pink — April 1, 2013","bg":"thrash-and-burn-ariel-pink-press-release","bi":", done-for-now","bj":"Thrash And Burn Press Release"},{"bl":"c4610153-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Tombstones reconstitutes the ghost of the voice.

Slipping down the inexorable mountain-slope of tones in \"New Orleans\", or bearing mute witness to the dark octaves that loom over Julia Holter's delicate vocal on \"Silent Cloud\", you get the feeling that Tombstones, like Pierre Klossowski's viscious spinning Baphomet, wants to draw all histories out into the open, and to make them speak.\n\n_**M**: \"The tombstones take tiny fragments of old and not-so-old songs and put them into an experimental music situation, introducing them to a kind of chaos, where the arrangement of the written out material is up for grabs.\"_\n\nThis presents an exhilarating challenge in a culture already saturated by hallucination, paradox, and shadowplay. Each \"tombstone\", as these tracks are called, is literally a \"sampled\" bit of structure, tuning, lyricism, beat or phrasing; a mystery moment sourced from perhaps, The Beatles, DJ Screw, Bob Dylan or UGK, to name a few. (The actual sources are a closely guarded secret, but in some cases not hard to guess.)\n\n_**M**: \"I selected performances with this question in mind: Did the song happen?\"_\n\nPisaro boils the archetype of sampling down to a fragment of intention, the groundwork of a sound, and ultimately, a cultural _technê_ at once beyond the reach, and at the origin of the act of editing. Or in other words, it's the knowledge-seeker's paradox in music: While it is not possible to know all there is in creation, it is quite possible to distill the elegant, simple processes at its heart. With this distillation, Pisaro attempts to freeze one curious tension after another, in which the voice (or the archetype of the voice) is shaken out of a field of interferences, and made to speak as if in song.\n\n_**M**: \"At least one singer and at least three instruments... Each chord (sustained) for itself with any amount of time between them ... an occasional, vaguely defined noise which occurs two or three times during the chords.\"_\n\nIn the band, electronics are conspicuously absent (but not forbidden). Two electric guitars (played by Grier and Pisaro) appear. Otherwise, Tombstones relies on a rather economical spread of acoustic instruments and percussion, some conventional, some not-so-conventional. The pulsating drones of harmonium (Tashi Wada, Julia Holter) and e-bow guitar anchor the field with unwavering strings (Cassia Streb, Laura Steenberge, Laena Myers-Ionita) and flute (Kelly Coats) performed without a hint of vibrato. Percussionist Rob Esler offers a surprising range of naturalistic (sometimes eerily synthsiser-like) performances that aim for halo more than punctuation.\n\nThe effect will be familiar to those who frequently listen to like-minded music whose focus is on unmediated experience of the subtlest timbres. However, in Tombstones' zoomed-in context, a double-image is generated: A face in lucidity and a face in suspense. Suspended, as it were, between exhilaration and anticipation, vocalists Janet Kim, Julia Holter, Laura Steenberge and Lisa Tolentino each approach their performances in unique ways.\n\nLisa Tolentino's performances in \"Blues Fall\" and \"A Better Way\" (which bookend the album) are perfectly nuanced between storytelling, and reverence for the delicate conditions in which her voice must carry only the memory of a narrative. In the former track, \"Blues Fall\", her confidence holds sway in the midst of a maelstrom of sound. Yet it's this very confidence that lends the ensemble its fearsome character. But as Janet Kim's plainspoken intonation descends well below its range in the similar droning mass of \"New Orleans\", you can't help but think of a very different situation in the face of the storm: frailty, surprise, and collapse.\n\nThis brings us to the very nature of Pisaro's composition technique, which preserves the experimental situation (one of probabilities, conditions and descriptions) within a realm of risk and wonder. In \"Fool\", we have the impossibly protracted dimensions of a single line from the hook to UGK's rap ballad \"One Day\" (we'll give you that one). But a closer look at the score reveals not an act of dissection, nor a state of chance, but a state of trust. The ensemble must feel out how long to make sound. They must choose on instinct, when to start and when to stop. Pisaro offers only just-so-many-notes, or just-so-few dynamic markings. It's like a blind descent. A release of mourning. A release from mourning. Again happy.","as":"f4820720-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"tombstones.jpg","aw":"8","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Michael Pisaro — June 19, 2012","bg":"tombstones-michael-pisaro-press-release","bi":", done-for-now","bj":"Tombstones Press Release","bk":"Tomb&shy;stones Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612866-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"\"'Unbekannte' is a German word for the unknown, or unknown quantity.

It's an album about the precipice that brings life to\nnothingness and nothingness to life, only to leave certainty suspended in its orbit. In other words, this headless Baphomet: a\nrepeated journey from climax to climax in which noema and aporia are ever­entangled. Is an uncertain future just like a sky out of\norder? Or rather like a blessing from God? Is our inability to fully love related to our inability to take the measure of this world\nfully? Or is there an unwillingness to love; a stubbornness about devotion that cannot be likened to the incalculability of nature's\nfull extent?\"<br>\n– Jason Grier, 2013_</small>\n\n<small>_\"Grier begins this record singing a simple and sweet­voiced a cappella song promising nothing: \"Baby, I don't know right now\",\nleaving us curious. He, like Lucrecia Dalt, has spent a lot of time making more conventionally­formed solid songs, but here he goes\nfurther than he ever has from straight songwriting.  Almost every \"song\" on this record features one specific recording or field\nrecording that is explored for a while, with a strangely pleasing way of beginning soft and gentle, and growing more and more\nmysterious (maybe even frightening) as time progresses. As a whole, it's like a series of captivating and mysterious short films.\"\n– Julia Holter, 2013_</small>\n\nFor his first major studio album Jason Grier assembles a bewildering musical vocabulary acquired during his tenure as director of Human Ear Music. After working the better part of a decade as a curator moving freely between pop and experimental circles, Grier sought to put his curatorial ethos into a singular artistic statement. Within Unbekannte’s dense 35 minutes, allusions to Michael Pisaro, James Tenney, Alvin Lucier, Pan Sonic, Giancinto Scelsi, Phill Niblock, Jodeci, Woo, etc, are deployed in a sprawling post­studio framework.\n\n\"Unbekannte\" is German word which means \"unknown\", \"unknown person\", or in a mathematical context, \"variable\", or \"unknown quantity\". Appropriately, the album comprises a series of lyrical settings, assembled from a year of assiduous, yet decidedly aleatoric studio sessions. Grier would offer to his engineer, his band, and himself, little more direction than \"just play something melancholic while I put on this meditation record\", or \"what does it sound like to cut this wire here? then here! then here!!\" He commissioned hour­long cymbal solos, spun psychoacoustic tone­webs from thousands of guitar harmonics, used rewired guitar amps as sub­bass microphones, and recorded the spontaneous sizzling of snare drums placed in a sealed room beside bass oscillators set at extreme volume levels. Each session led to a uniquely gorgeous dead end, its purpose seeming to be the fabrication of an endless sequence of exotic sound objects. After a year of aimless experimentation, it looked as if a grand theme was nowhere to be found. It was the studio album reduced to the creation of a sample library. Likewise, it was the artist eerily struck from the act of creation just at the moment when he should be fully realized. But this was, in fact, Grier’s \"grand\" theme: to squint right back, with a half­smile, at pop music’s faustian promise to transform introspection into self­affirming sound objects. In the process of assembling this material into album format, Grier let all the sentimentality of lyric songwriting fall out of its own framework like fraying threads. Then he observed the variety of ways in which these threads decompose over time; into noise, into silence, into cancelled morphologies, into quivering amplitudes, into jolting textures. For Grier, uncertainty is not a point of collapse, but a point of departure, and a point of return. And as such, Unbekannte is a searching critique of the studio’s alchemical powers, as much as it is an ostentatious display of those powers.\n\nBut if Unbekannte is a challenging listen, that’s not just because of its extravagant, sometimes brutalist sonic pallette. Unbekannte’s real challenge is its wry exploration of the limits of certainty in love, identity, and ontology. Inspired by the concrete poetry of Helmut Heißenbüttel and Haroldo de Campos, Grier’s hyper­minimalist lyric style stretches terse, brutally ambivalent fragments of dialogue across an entire vocal track.\n\n***1***\n\n<small>_\"What if I could say for sure... if I can stay on the ground... if I can stay on my\nfeet... if you can believe in me... if I can save you the pain?\"_</small>\n\nThe opening track, \"Baby I Don’t Know Right Now\"  – an airless a capella, dry, no trace of reverb – is as harmonically rich as it is claustrophobic. The extended silences between verses disrupt and emphasize this track’s fragile identity, balanced as it is between heartbreaker and cold hard sound­object. Grier’s approach might imitate the romanticism of some Jodeci improv he once watched in his tweens, on an American late­night talk show in the 90’s. But the singer appropriated here is neither a heartbroken victim, nor a romantic hero, nor an emotional victimizer. The singer is simply the quintessential error­of­omission, the voice of all those moments of doubt when we can locate no proper answer to the question \"how does it feel to be you?\"\n\nThe next two tracks lay the groundwork for Grier’s treatment of sound. \"Der Wind und das Meer\" and \"The\nWidows\" are quasi­hymnic tableaux that build upon simple motifs (acoustic guitar and violin, respectively)\nuntil the layers become so detailed as to collapse into sensory overload. This is noise, not as a dialectical\ncounterpart to sensual order, but as a function of senses overwhelmed; detail to the point of unintelligibility.\nAnother way to put it: Grier is a minimalist, in his insistence that the materiality of sound must take\nprecedence over development and variation. But he is an expressionist, in that he entices his own\nsound­objects to collide, amplify, harmonize, overwhelm, and finally, rub themselves raw.\n\n\"Cover Me\", anchoring the album’s first half, is the ballad of a seducer who knows how much pleasure the\nobject of his/her desire can derive from the memory of a trampled heart. It begins with warm words enough,\nbut in the course of just three phrases, the song’s one line turns as cold and sinister as a winter alone. The\nblurred overtones of Telecasters and bass oscillators accompany this glacial unfolding of suspense,\nelation, paradox, climax and dénouement, as the listener is slowly exposed to the twists and turns of\nsentiment contained in a single sentence:\n\n<small>_\"Lie by my knees;<br>\nI can warm you<br>\nlike the thought of<br>\nthe lover you<br>\nhad yesterday<br>\nbent at your knees<br>\non the pavement.\"_</small>\n\nCover Me climaxes with a stygian chamber orchestra consisting of blown bassbins, ungrounded power lines, and crackling microphones, before collapsing gently into waves of bass­on­bass counterpoint between detuned guitars and turntables with their ground wires stripped out. \"Gravity Well\" creates aporia – attractive waves of silence – by allowing simple tones to make contact, and dissolve.\n\n\"My Love Knows No Fascism\" brings the album’s midpoint to an unusually psychedelic plateaux. This track\nis also unusual in its use of effects processing, which is otherwise almost entirely absent throughout\nUnbekannte. Tremolo­soaked guitars play a lazy afternoon riff harmonized by oscillators, bells and field\nrecordings sourced from a disintegrating relaxation record Grier found on a thrift­shopping expedition.\nAgainst this warm sunny backdrop, Grier whispers, in Spanish, a heartfelt, vexingly sweet assertion:\n\n<small>_\"My love without limit, that I can barely see.<br>\nYou cannot lie. You cannot be unjust.<br>\nInterminably, complicatedly, eternally, contrarily.\"_</small>\n\nIn other words, love can indeed embody justice, and vice versa, but only if it is infinitely ambivalent.\n\n***2***\n\nAfter collaborating in the past with Julia Holter and Nite Jewel, Grier considered a number of guest vocalists for \"Unbekannte\". But in the end he decided the album should contain only two voices: his own, and that of Spanish­Colombian singer Lucrecia Dalt. The resonance thus created is both archetypal and intensely autobiographical. (Grier and Dalt being recent immigrants to unknown territory in Berlin.) Yet their vocal performances are never dramatized. Rather, they hold steady over Unbekannte’s currents of noise, texture, harmony and drone. In this way, Unbekannte’s voices become alloyed in a quivering tension which builds even as it remains motionless. This tension finally overflows in the two­part \"Helen Of Troy\".\n\nUnbekannte’s most ambitious statement, \"Helen Of Troy\" brings the idea of unknowability into a psychosocial frame. It opens with the testimonial of a schizophrenic patient at Pitié­Salpêtrière in the mid­19th century, as recorded by François Leuret. (The German translation used here was famously quoted by Austrian experimental psychiatrist Leo Navratil, in his book \"Schizophrenie und Sprache\" in 1976.) It is the bizarre, and bizarrely skillful, testimonial of an alter­ego without origin. Not a hallucinated Other, nor a reconstituted Same, but a phantasm­like \"person of me\":\n\n<small>_\"The person of me is the child of no one. The origin of the person of me is<br>\nunknown. She has no memory of from whence she came. The woman of whom<br>\nyou speak is perhaps she for which one had made this dress.\"_</small>\n\nThe patient’s confession is recited in three times: Once in the dark vacuum of an earthshaking sub­bass chord, next, over an assault of sizzling snare drums, and finally, as introduction to the eerie calm of a long interval on clarinet. Afterward, the clarinet ensemble builds a lush fabric of tones slowly, amassing an organ­like block chord, only to find itself stuck at that moment in a digital loop. The vocalists then intone the hallucinatory dream of \"Helen\" – the embodiment of the point where psychological fragmentation and public schizophrenia meet:\n\n<small>_\"Ask me so, but unfortunately, I do not know whom you ask.<br>\nOught we come together with all the personalities<br>\nthat we with all Europe in this city thus created?<br>\nWho can tell Helen’s story? Try to ask me her old name.<br>\nDressmaker, sew miracles in this dress, just for me.<br>\nI’ll put it on, go out walking, take a walk, go to be all the people.\"_</small>\n\nAll the people in my head? Or all the people in the world? The lyrics make abrupt transitions from Spanish to German to English, to further the confusion of identity, nationality and speech. Eventually the vocals themselves become stuck in a catatonic nausea of some infinite delay. Except it becomes clear on a closer listen that the 37 repetitions of \"all the people\" were sung individually, not looped. With their tantric backing band, those words obtain a mantra­like persistence. They confess that we are unable to be all souls and to count all souls at the same time. The \"person of me\" is over­multiplied until she becomes the schizophrenia of a whole city – particularly Berlin, with its fragmented history, polymorphic array of languages, and dizzying social entanglements.\n\n***3***\n\nGrier then brings the album steadily to a close, traversing genre­space with an oddly­matched series of\ntableaux. Again, only a single, slowly unfolding, sentence is needed:\n\n<small>_\"In this fireplace,<br>\nin this burning heart,<br>\nall the thoughts that<br>\ncan’t get expressed yet<br>\nwill be there<br>\nto keep you warm,<br>\nto comfort your head,<br>\nin the winter.\"_</small>\n\nSounding like a shredded spaghetti­western atmosphere shrouded in the hum and hiss of a malfunctioning\nEMI limiter, \"¡Salud!\" is a last moment of reflection on the way to Unbekannte’s surprising conclusion.\nBefore the winter, before the unknown begs its question, the choir salutes:\n\n<small>_\"Salud, Salida!\"_</small>\n\n\"Cheers! Exit!\" Grier reminds us here not to leave anything behind. Because if we do, all we’ll have to keep\n\nus warm in the winter will be the thoughts we failed to express today. Cheers and goodbye. It’s time to embrace the future. Dalt returns once again for a lush, wordless chorale, backed by 808’s, vibraphones and rubbed stones. It’s a sentimental pause before a barrage of roaring cymbals comes in with a narrative charge that condenses Unbekannte’s sonic explorations into a single punctuation mark. Then \"Silent Betonung\" (\"Silent Emphasis\") – a dub jam carved in negative space from carefully selected slabs of distortion and feedback – is the accompaniment to the album’s final words:\n\n<small>_\"Y después, Y después, Y después...\"_</small>\n\n\"And then. And then. And then...\" Unbekannte’s final track is this plea’s voiceless answer. As finales go, it is beautifully indifferent, and unexpectedly simple. Hundreds of overdubbed sleigh bells ring out an even, unmodulated field of sparkling tones.\n\nA heaven of bells.","as":"f4825540-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"unbekannte.jpg","aw":"6","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Jason Grier — December 17, 2013","bg":"unbekannte-jason-grier-press-release","bi":", done-for-now","bj":"Unbekannte Press Release","bk":"Unbe&shy;kannte Press Release"},{"ac":"Jason Grier","ah":"press-releases","ai":"April 2014","aj":"\n\n\"Whatever... at the Darkness of Night: \nThe HEM Compilation 2014\"\nInfos:\nFormats: LP (with download card), Digital\nRelease Date: 03.

This release also concludes a year of remastering and restoration work that began shortly after the label's european migration. It \ncombines tracks from previous HEM compilations dating back to 2006 with recordings from HEM concerts in 2009 and 2010. Lucrecia Dalt \ncontributes a previously-unreleased lock groove instrumental to conclude the album.\nSide A starts with 5 tracks from the first HEM compilation–a CD-R in handmade packaging–released in 2006. \"A very very fancy and exclusive \nsocial club,\" it was fabled to be, in the first press releases tipped by internet journals like Pitchfork and Tiny Mix Tapes. All hyperbole aside, \nHEM started, indeed, with a close-connected social group, one that included Ariel Pink, Nite Jewel and Julia Holter. They worked solo, and in \ncountless collaborative permutations, and were deeply indebted to the rising popularity of the home-recording aesthetic. But their take on it \nwas ever so tongue-in-cheek, such that the early HEM's combination of campy pomposity and sketchy nods to various pop genres have, over \nthe years, come across as mystifying (if not seriously off-putting) to many a reviewer... or as pure (human) genius to a few. Whatever \nconclusion is to be reached about HEM-circa-2006, the early tracks do represent a knowingly irreverent take on what would, in the 3 or 4 years \nto follow, become a genre that took itself rather more seriously: \"lo-fi\" pop.\nTracks like \"The Weird Wolf\" and \"Trance Parents\" fit this description perfectly. \"Trance Parents\" (a collaboration between Ariel Pink and \nGeneva Jacuzzi) with its relentless puns and in-jokes, snapshots a time when there were serious rumors of  the collective's plans to move to \nDubai: \"I say hello, you say Dubai.\" Yet tracks like Ry Rocklen's \"Under the Radar\", and John Maus' unabashedly devotional \"For Ariel Pink\" \nreveal that there can be a strange kind of candidness to this format. Even more candid–disarmingly so–is \"No Sweat\", from the wryly-named \nproject \"Holy Shit\". This track confronts the artist's destitution with a harried smirk that perhaps serves to remind us that to record on a \ngrungy 4-track might not always have been 100% a matter of style.\nOn the other hand, upward mobility might be best illustrated by the final track on Side A of this record. It is a live recording from HEM's 3-day \n\"Trauermusik\" festival in Los Angeles, the last before HEM would close shop in Los Angeles. Julia Holter croons an early version of \"Goddess \nEyes\", a song which would not just see a taste of wider exposure, but would undergo a few aesthetic upgrades to match. \"Goddess Eyes\" would \nmorph from this live loop-pedal version, to a softly home-produced track on Holter's breakthrough \"Tragedy\" LP a year later, only to see a \ntighter, more professional-sounding mix another year after that.\nSide B then takes the HEM story farther away from, but at the same time strangely closer to, home. The label first attracted spiritual \nforefathers (and mothers) in the form of brief engagements with the \"out\" pop musicians of the past, including Gary Wilson and Linda Perhacs. \n\nThis side begins with a live recording of Perhacs' \"Chimacum Rain\" from an HEM-organized event at the San Francisco Art Institute, held \nshortly after the label re-opened in 2010, for a year-long residency in San Francisco. Perhacs and then band-mate Holter accompanied each \nother through much of the set. In addition to this dive into the past, HEM began to find broader geographical horizons in its San Francisco days. \nTracks from (then) Oakland-based Jeepneys and (then) Brooklyn-based Laurel Halo appeared, respectively, on 7-inch and on HEM's 2010 \ncassette compilation. The delicate–and irresistibly named–collaboration between Holter and Nite Jewel, \"Nite Jewelia\", also appeared on the \n2010 cassette comp, and seemed an appropriate revisit to the home recording style of 2006. But by now, not only had HEM geographically \ndiversified, but it had pretty much become genre-agnostic. Indeed, while the early \"bedroom pop\" material could trade the transformation of \n(or the risking of) real naivety for the conceptual labor of insouciance, and while many artists' post/non-HEM projects ventured into serious \nmass appeal, HEM's active roster would gradually begin to fall back less and less on pop for conceptual redemption.\nThe eleventh track, Michael Pisaro's \"For Madison\", might be the perfect example of just what unites the early, insouciant years of HEM with \nits avant-leaning present. This track, in just a few minutes, stretches (or perhaps oversteps entirely) the tethers that separate field recording, \nsampling, appropriation art, modern composition, and pop music.\nA live performance of a work by John Cage follows in the next track, furthering HEM's web of connections and influences. In 2009, Cage's \n\"Songbooks\" was orchestrated by Jason Grier (HEM's continuing director and primary ideologue) for Michael Pisaro's \"Dog Star Orchestra\" \nfestival in Valencia, California. And it was, indeed, here, in Valencia, at the California Institute of the Arts, where Grier and Ariel Pink first met, \nand where Julia Holter and John Maus studied with Pisaro. In this Cage track, as in the Pisaro track that precedes it, pop music returns to HEM, \nto peer through the veil of the concept–through the window of John Cage's variable instrumentation–as some orchestra members chose \nwhole music recordings as their \"instrument\".\nThis album finishes with two artists from HEM's (present day) Berlin contingent, Ekkehard Ehlers and Lucrecia Dalt.

This release also concludes a year of remastering and restoration \nwork that began shortly after the label's european migration. It combines tracks from \nprevious HEM compilations dating back to 2006 with recordings from HEM concerts in \n2009 and 2010. Lucrecia Dalt contributes a previously-unreleased lock groove instru-\nmental to conclude the album.mental to conclude the album.\nSide A starts with 5 tracks from the first HEM compilation—a CD-R in handmade packag-\ning—released in 2006. \"A very very fancy and exclusive social club,\" it was fabled to be, in \nthe first press releases, tipped by internet journals like Pitchfork and Tiny Mix Tapes. Set-\nting such hyperbole aside, HEM, indeed, did start with a close-connected social group-\none that included Ariel Pink, Nite Jewel and Julia Holter. They worked both solo and in \ncountless collaborative permutations, and were deeply indebted to the rising popularity \nof the home-recording aesthetic. But their take on it was ever so tongue-in-cheek, such \nthat the early HEM's combination of campy pomposity and sketchy nods to various pop \ngenres have, over the years, come across as mystifying (if not seriously off-putting) to \nmany a reviewer... or as pure (human) genius to a few. Whatever conclusion is to be \nreached about HEM-circa-2006, the early tracks do represent a knowingly irreverent \ntake on what would, in the 3 or 4 years to follow, become a genre that took itself rather \nmore seriously: \"lo-fi\" pop.\nTracks like \"The Weird Wolf\" and \"Trance Parents\" fit this description perfectly. \"Trance \nParents\" (a collaboration between Ariel Pink and Geneva Jacuzzi) with its unrelenting \npuns and in-jokes, snapshots a time when there were serious rumors of  the collective's \nplans to move to Dubai: \"I say hello, you say Dubai.\" Yet tracks like Ry Rocklen's \"Under \nthe Radar\", and John Maus' unabashedly devotional \"For Ariel Pink\" reveal that there can \nbe a strange kind of candidness to this format. Even more candid—disarmingly so—is \"No \nSweat\", from the wryly-named project \"Holy Shit\". This track confronts the artist's desti-\ntution with a harried smirk that perhaps serves to remind us that to record on a grimy 8tution with a harried smirk that perhaps serves to remind us that to record on a grimy 8-\ntrack cassette might not always have been 100% a matter of style. On the other hand, \nupward mobility might be best illustrated by the final track on Side A of this record. It is a \nlive recording from HEM's 3-day \"Trauermusik\" festival in Los Angeles, the last before \nHEM would close shop in Los Angeles. Julia Holter croons an early version of \"Goddess \nEyes\", a song which would not just see a taste of wider exposure, but would undergo a \nfew aesthetic upgrades to match. (\"Goddess Eyes\" would morph from this live loop-pedal \nversion, to a soft laptop-produced track on Holter's breakthrough \"Tragedy\" LP one year \nlater; only to see a tighter, more professional-sounding mix another year after that.)\nSide B then takes the HEM story farther away from, but at the same time strangely \ncloser to, home. The label first attracted spiritual forefathers (and mothers) in the form \nof brief engagements with the \"out\" pop musicians of the past, including Gary Wilson and \nLinda Perhacs. This side begins with a live recording of Perhacs' \"Chimacum Rain\" from \nan HEM-organized event at the San Francisco Art Institute, held shortly after the label \nre-opened in 2010, for a year-long residency in San Francisco. Perhacs and then band-\nmate Holter accompanied each other through much of the set. In addition to this dive \ninto the past, HEM began to find broader geographical horizons in its San Francisco days. \nTracks from (then) Oakland-based Jeepneys and (then) New York-based Laurel Halo ap-\npeared, respectively, on 7-inch and on HEM's 2010 cassette compilation. The delicate-\nand irresistibly named—collaboration between Holter and Nite Jewel, \"Nite Jewelia\", \nalso appeared on the 2010 cassette comp, and seemed an appropriate revisit to the \nhome recording style of 2006. But by now HEM had not only geographically diversified; \nit had pretty much become genre-agnostic. While the early \"bedroom pop\" material could \ntrade the transformation of (or the risking of) real naivety for the conceptual labor of in-\nsouciance, and while many artists' post/non-HEM projects ventured into serious mass \nappeal, HEM's catalogue would gradually begin to fall back less and less on pop for con-\nceptual redemption.\nThe eleventh track, Michael Pisaro's \"For Madison\", might be the perfect example of just \nwhat unites the early, insouciant years of HEM with its avant-leaning present. This \ntrack—in just a few minutes—stretches (or perhaps oversteps entirely) the thinning teth-\ners that separate field recording, sampling, appropriation art, modern composition, and \npop music. A live performance of a work by John Cage follows in the next track, further-\ning HEM's web of connections and influences. In 2009, Cage's \"Songbooks\" was orches-\ntrated by Jason Grier (HEM's continuing director and primary ideologue) for Michael \nPisaro's \"Dog Star Orchestra\" festival in Valencia, California. And it was, indeed, here—in \nValencia, at the California Institute of the Arts—where Jason Grier and Ariel Pink first \nmet; where Julia Holter and John Maus studied with Michael Pisaro. In this Cage track, \nas in the Pisaro track that precedes it, popular music returns to HEM, to peer through \nthe veil of the concept—through the window of John Cage's variable instrumentation.\nThis album is completed by two artists from HEM's (present day) Berlin contingent, Ek-\nkehard Ehlers and Lucrecia Dalt. Ehlers practices a similar kind of magic to Pisaro, only \nthis time conjuring up avant garde music's Ursprung and reshuffling it into a post-glitch \nmoodscape. It falls upon Lucrecia Dalt to create her own compelling synthesis of HEM's \npop past and its freeform present. Her work around this time begins to play increasingly \non the undecidable consequences of pinning states of song to states of mind. Her contri-\nbution ends this album with a lock groove, wavering on infinitely, defiantly, and mysteri-\nously, much like the ongoing history of HEM.\nTRACKLIST:\nA\n1.

about this hard-to-explain octopus of a project, which 4 years later seems much more light, sensual, and concrete than it once did","ah":"general-content","aj":"Demonstration Disc brought up this question of whether or not a work of art could be seen only as a labor horizon. I spent more than a year cutting and splicing audio samples in lieu of making any progress on an actual album. At the time this repetitive, wheel-spinning activity I truly felt was an activism or a vigil against (or at least a recalcitrant kind of procrastination of) the \"album cycle\". In doing it, I set up the work to be a kind of _labor performance_. In terms of getting one's self to the \"Artwork X by Artist Y\" stage and releasing something to the world, my sisyphean task was simply an endless never-becoming.\n\nToo, lurking within this question were the implications that labor and performativity were overlapping somehow, and that the artwork itself was in some way the very effacement of the _art labor_ which gave it life.\n\nIn the former case I could truly say that this was a labor performance cause my day job was the actual work I was doing —and _had_ to do— for money. And the main symptom I got from living through this scission between _performed labor and labor performed_ was this heightened awareness (hatred, if it's not too strong a word) of the obligatory nature of the day job versus this heightened awareness (again, hatred, if it's not too strong a word) of the complicity of art in its own self-fetishisation via the reification of the invisibility of labor. The two hatreds were kind of dissonant and kind of not, and their various points of friction kept my interest level high.\n\nIn the latter case, it was as if the polish and sheen of the final product, and the praise and admiration reflected back upon the final product's author, instantly wiped out the history of toil and hardship suffered in getting to that point. Even though they shared one and the same body, in place of the art laborer came the ✨Artiste✨ whose golden glow _authorised_ the artwork to perform its mythologizing/sanitizing operations on the whole architecture of despair that was its engendering. But both being the laborer and being the author were key narrative movements in the formation of identity (not just in the creative sphere but in the whole psychological/sociopolitical sphere), so in my own way, I see now how I was trying to find out how to make these two narratives to overlay, rather than annihilate one another.\n\nFour years later I ask these questions in slightly modulated ways. On the one hand I see this project with a deeper perspicacity, as it is clear to me that concerns of identity and gender are more central to the thoughts \"labor performance\" and \"artistic labor\", respectively, than they seemed to me at the time; no mere lurkers, but rather more like avatars. In this way, the work is much less abstract and \"conceptual\" than I naively thought it to be.\n\nOn the other hand I see the project with more nuance, sensuality, and lightness than before. Maybe the key to this is in my poker-faced insistence that the album is merely a \"user guide\" for the Sound Library, which was where all this cutting and splicing wound up in the end. This joke is so easy to see through, considering the album is clearly thematic and emotive and sonically... sinewy... (at least to most people I've talked to). But I'm sticking to this joke to an, itself, hilarious extent; putting sound packs up on Github, dispassionately offering stuff for download as music tools, using numbers as track titles, etc. Add to that the blundering progress of this robot, Seurat, which I built to endlessly cook up potential song ideas using the library sounds, and then serve them up as a soundtrack to my _real_ work day in startup land. Many twists and turns.\n\nOne reviewer commented that The Disc was like what noise music sounded like to a control freak. Which again, in retrospect, was the best review of all, because it completed the project's _reductio ad absurdum_ in a way that I never could. However, something that bugged me all this time was the album's length. It was vinyl vanity again, basing the work's running time on whether or not it could fit on a 12-inch LP. But to make it any longer, to indulge the sounds and go deeper into them, to make them out to be creatures which \"deserve\" some kind of proper caress,  might be to let some semblance of sentimentality through, to lose control freakiness and just be freaky, so to speak.\n\nStill, I find myself planning out a \"deluxe, not time-boxed edition\" now and then, and maybe that's going to happen this year. And it is true that my live set contains a lot of the sounds on Demonstration Disc, and often goes for several hours. So maybe that's the proper length for The Disc... Or maybe someone will pick up on the possibility that all the \"example sounds\" on the website _are_ in effect, \"Demonstration Disc II\".\n\n","as":"22cbe05e-af56-4841-8b89-a6786564b2b4","aw":"blog:1","bu":"jag.rip","az":true,"bg":"demonstration-disc-4-years-later","bi":"blog","bj":"Demonstration Disc, 4 Years Later"}]

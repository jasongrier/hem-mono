Electric Guitar: Feedback\n\nConsists of 27 takes of scorching feedback made with a hand-built \"scream\" pedal. When used with a long attack and release, and heavy reverb, creates a vast soundscape that could be interpreted as either heavenly, or demonic.\n\n### 3. Electric Guitar: Chords\n\nConsists of 9 pretty straightforward chords, going up in fifths, some arpeggiated.

Originally intended to beam thoughts of relaxation, therapy, tranquility, and self-realisation to the listener, these musty old recordings now take on a whole new layer questioning.","ah":"sound-library","ai":"2021","aj":"Between 1981 until his death in 1996, Canadian photographer, cinematographer and field recordist Dan Gibson made over 100 releases of lush and somewhat vexing recordings of the natural world. Titles like \"Relax Peacefully\", \"Heavenly Hawaii\", and \"Solitudes Nurture the Soul\" say it all. Armed with excellent ears and state-of-the-art gear, Gibson made some quality field recordings, all the while seemingly aloof to the genre's vaunted status among the avant-garde. Discogs classifies his work as \"Non-Music\", as \"Therapy\". A number of his tracks feature natural environments overlaid with soothing classical pieces, beaming thoughts of tranquility, solitude, and relaxation to the listener. There was even a Christmas album.\n\nLike a kind of Bob Ross of field recording, either knowingly or not, Gibson's work raises some intriguing questions about just what a field recording is, can, and should be; both from a functional standpoint, and with respect to aural pleasure.\n\nAre field recordings merely relaxation soundtracks? Medley ingredients to stir in a pot overdubbed with \"classics\" by Bach, Debussy, Pachelbel, and Chopin? Is Gibson's work like field recording stripped of its criticality? Or is it hypercritical? Is avant-garde field recording taking itself too seriously? In a strange and likely unintentional parallel with Luc Ferrari's \"Far West News\" and \"Promenade\", or Michael Pisaro's \"Continuum Unbound\", Gibson's work deflects the rarifications of pure field recording by treading into the realms of medley, composition, and collage. \n\nGibson's self-founded label \"Solitudes\" changed hands several times over the years, before being liquidated along with its final parent company in 2016, relegating his catalogue to the dustbin of history. A promotional sampler LP of Solitudes, discovered in a San Francisco secondhand store, became the source material for this sample pack. Scratched and weathered, the vinyl patina adds yet another layer of complication as to how to situate this work.\n\nFurthermore, when deployed here as a sample pack, is this LP still an instance of field recording? Or is it crate-digging at this point? Isn't field recording always-already \"found sound\" anyways? Does the undeniable cloud of vinyl pops, clicks, and distortion constitute a field of its own?\n\n### About the Instruments\n\nThis pack consists of 16 virtual instruments —one for each track of the Solitudes promo LP— playable on a full 88-key keyboard.

Every click has subtle differences\n\n### C3: Compressor hiss\n\nA DIY clone of a vintage Universal Audio 1176 compressor from a mail-order kit. The hand-assembled unit produced an unruly amount of hiss, which here has been put through several stages of amplification, exposing minuscule structure to the otherwise flat, undifferentiated white noise \n\n### C#3—D#3: Concrete Masonry Units\n\nSome concrete masonry units (also known as \"cinderblocks\" in the US) lying around that were left over from the studio's construction. Sometimes these blocks got used as doorstops or kick drum stops. In this sample, the blocks are recorded being rubbed against one another, new-music style\n\n### E3—A#3: Crumbling Studio Insulation\n\nIn the summer, the windows in the hall were covered with aluminium foil to insulate against Berlin's sweltering heat. Inevitably, the heat would win, causing the insulation to peel from the window and flap in the breeze. When close-mic'ed, this flapping sometimes yielded an impressive, almost thunderous sound\n\n### B3—D5: Patch cable\n\nA patch cable with a conductivity problem —probably frayed layers of insulation beneath the outer wrapping— being investigated while still plugged in to the patch bay\n\n### D#5—G5: Squeaky Live Room Door\n\nThe hinges to the door to the live room apparently hadn't been oiled in a while.

These instruments can be unearthly, celestial, and endlessly fun to play, though the samples themselves consist of, essentially, \"audio waste\".\n\n__How it was made__\n\nThe original recording was taken from a damaged vinyl LP of field recordings dating back to 1977, discovered in a second-hand store in San Francisco. It is the sound of a bubbling creek somewhere in rural America. The rejected frequencies were sampled from the noise reduction plugin's \"B\" channel, which permits real-time monitoring of the parts of the sound that are being thrown out.\n\nAudio cleanups were done at four levels of noise reduction. Additionally, the creek recording was eq'd at 4k, 6k, and 8k, resulting in 12 samples total. Since the four noise reduction levels were all near or at maximum —well beyond the recommended settings— the resulting artifacts are exaggeratedly musical, rather than clinical. They sound similar to a very low quality MP3, or to vintage spectral synthesis heard in so-called \"early electronic\" music.\n\n## Mirror World Sound World\n\nSome mirrored histories:\n\nIn 1968, Danish composer Per Nørgård premiered \"Voyage into the Golden Screen\", considered by some to be the first proper piece of spectralist music.\n\nIn 1979, Hugues Dufourt formalised the spectralist movement, defining spectralism as music which deals, not with timbre, tone, and rhythm, but with frequency as a graph over time; a _visual_ thing that can be edited, displaced, redrawn, erased or excised.\n\nIn 1989, Fraunhofer-Gesellshaft received a patent in Germany for the MP3. Emerging from a teeming pack of prototypal \"psychoacoustic modelling\" algorithms, the MP3 codec became the standard means of excising spectral components from sound to yield more portable digital files. Similar spectral (FFT) approaches yielded algorithms to reduce noise, transients, clicks, pops, hums, and other audio gunk from digital recordings.\n\nThe evolution of the spectral consciousness of sound from a bold aesthetic move to a clinical means of filtering and compressing audio should come as no surprise from an engineering point of view. But from an artistic standpoint it's somewhat surprising that what once was a force of creation is now an agent of excision, compression; the decreative force of aporia.\n\nAs it is with the utopian projects that once promised to create a new world by means of heavy industry...\n\n~\n\nIn November 1986, 20 tons of toxic red-coloured extinguishing foam was dumped into the Rhine.\n\nIn April 2014, the City of flint, Michigan decided to switch its water source from Detroit's water system back to the Flint River. After decades of industrial pollution and failed cleanup attempts, the river retains high levels of chlorides. These chlorides erode plumbing, causing toxic sediments to leech into the water delivered to local homes for drinking, cooking, washing, and gardening; overwhelmingly affecting black and brown people.\n\nOn the 3rd of June, 2020, near the city of Norilsk in Siberia, 20,000 tons of diesel leaked into the Ambarnaya river. The water is clouded and red, with bizarre overtones of ochre and violet. It would be a mystifying body of water from a whole other world, if it weren't so damn deadly.\n\nThe cleanup of disaster zones like these can take decades, if total cleanup can be achieved at all. As with the Flint River, byproducts can remain in the water long after the primary pollutants have been successfully extracted. Furthermore, if the toxic materials are successfully removed, something must be done with them. Can they be broken down into innocuous substances? Contained safely underground or above ground in drums? Made useful again in other industries? etc.\n\n~\n\nHere, too, we are cleaning up a river.\n\nIt is a river recorded in 1977 and pressed onto vinyl for a corny series of \"natural soundscapes\" marketed to a pop audience. The LP, having rotted away in a San Francisco second-hand store for god-knows-how-long, is not in the best condition. The audio is clouded and distorted; the vinyl clicking and popping, the equalisation is shot to hell, and the dynamics are flat and lifeless.\n\nThis audio needs cleanup.\n\nFor this, we'll use an algorithm very much like the MP3, an algorithm born from the bloodline of spectralist music, an algorithm embedded in a plugin widely used in the music industry on a daily basis for audio restoration, clarification of field recordings, and correction of flawed studio takes. (To avoid commercialisation, we'll not mention the name of this plugin.) We pipe the audio to our plugin, choose some equalisation settings, use a spectral window to create a fingerprint of the undesirable noises, click \"render\", and... bam!\n\nWe have successfully cleaned up this river.\n\nIf only it were so simple in Flint, in Norilsk, in so many other real rivers around the globe. But our audio work can bear upon our understanding of such places. How we treat sound can be representative of how we treat nature and communities. Sound is in nature; is nature, after all.\n\n~\n\nSo now we have a pristine (recording of a) river. But what we're interested in is not the results of our cleanup, rather the byproducts of our cleanup. We're interested in the \"audio toxic waste\" and what can and should be done with it. What happened to it? Where did it go? Unlike chemical waste, this audio waste probably just got deleted. Because it can just be deleted. But what if we held on to it? Allowed it to persist the way chemical waste persists? What can we do about it? What can we do with it? What can it do with us?\n\nIf spectral cleanup is the removal of portions of a visual representation of a sound, then are the removed frequencies a kind of mirror image of the world we desired to get by doing cleanup? Is this mirror image also a world? Does it contain a tonal system? Do the sounds hold any aesthetic or critical interest? Can they be put to use in compositions? Sampled and _played_ on a drum pad? Can one find oneself at play in toxic waste?\n\nIn both the case of a river and of the recording of a river, the goal of a cleanup is to _make it as if the accident never happened_; even though it did. As the bizarre site in which toxicity thrived –red, ochre, violet, otherworldly– is relegated to memory, so is the ruinous mindlessness of contingency condemned to the desiccation of amnesia. In other words, how we got here is forgotten.\n\nSo in audio terms —again, letting how we treat sound be representative of how we treat nature and community— it must be useful, crucial even, to rehydrate the memory of this contingency, embodied in waste, and to play this waste like an instrument of its own, from a world of its own.\n","ak":"sound-library","al":"noise-reduction-artifacts.alp","bs":"5|25|45","ap":"1","aq":"25","as":"484b147b-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","at":true,"av":"noise-reduction-artifacts.jpg","aw":"7","ay":true,"az":true,"bc":"1","bg":"noise-reduction-artifacts","bi":"post-studio, sonic-detritus, psychoacoustics, featured, home-features","bj":"Noise Reduction Artifacts","bm":"Ableton Live Pack"}]

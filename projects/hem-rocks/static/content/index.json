Rather than sample a beat or a line from the music in whose absence these runout grooves follow, the end of the vinyl medium, the material on which the music was pressed is sampled.\n\nWhat results is a collection of sounds usable in both ambient and rhythm-oriented music in which the reference to the source material can only be imagined.\n\n__Note:__ This collection will be regularly updated with more loops.

Phenomenal drummer, Hogir Göregen stopped by with a couple of gorgeous instruments, an enormous Bendir (Turkish frame-drum) and a deep, velvet-sounding Darbuka. Toward the end of the day, he started playing anything he could get his hands on, including a little teal flowerpot half-filled with water.\n\nThe samples consist of single hits, rolls, and some blistering polyrhythmic  finger-drumming. It shows especially in the flower pot samples, where the tilting of the instrument is not only a means of modulating the dynamics and expressiveness, but causes sharp, sweet pitch bends as the water in the pot swishes around. Includes controls for attack, release, stereo, filtering, and delay. With just the right attack settings and rapid fingering, this pack can \"spectral freeze\" the bell-like overtones of some of the drum hits, for a heavenly sound.\n\nIn the breezy spirit of this afternoon session, the drum sounds are scattered all around the key range.

The takes are sliced across four octaves for this virtual instrument. Includes attack, decay, velocity, filter, and reverb options.\n\nThe bowed ride has a surprisingly ominous sound, considering the smooth-vibe role it usually plays in a Jazz ensemble. With lots of reverb, velocity sensitivity, and a gentle performance style, this can produce the feeling of a vast snowy landscape.\n\nAs with the ride cymbal, the crash completely reverses its nature when bowed. The loud and brash instrument seems unable to produce anything but a smooth meditative bass drone with when played with a bow. Peaceful and warm.\n\n### Workouts\n\nA collection of 31 highly expressive rolls on all the cymbals in the kit.

The association to noise and ambient genres is unavoidable. But the emergence of recognisable chants like \"Whose streets?

Emerging from a teeming pack of prototypal \"psychoacoustic modelling\" algorithms, the MP3 codec became the standard means of excising spectral components from sound to yield more portable digital files.

(To avoid commercialisation, we'll not mention the name of this plugin.) We pipe the audio to our plugin, choose some equalisation settings, use a spectral window to create a fingerprint of the undesirable noises, click \"render\", and... bam!\n\nWe have successfully cleaned up this river.\n\nIf only it were so simple in Flint, in Norilsk, in so many other real rivers around the globe. But our audio work can bear upon our understanding of such places. How we treat sound can be representative of how we treat nature and communities. Sound is in nature; is nature, after all.\n\n~\n\nSo now we have a pristine (recording of a) river. But what we're interested in is not the results of our cleanup, rather the byproducts of our cleanup. We're interested in the \"audio toxic waste\" and what can and should be done with it. What happened to it? Where did it go? Unlike chemical waste, this audio waste probably just got deleted. Because it can just be deleted. But what if we held on to it? Allowed it to persist the way chemical waste persists? What can we do about it? What can we do with it? What can it do with us?\n\nIf spectral cleanup is the removal of portions of a visual representation of a sound, then are the removed frequencies a kind of mirror image of the world we desired to get by doing cleanup? Is this mirror image also a world? Does it contain a tonal system? Do the sounds hold any aesthetic or critical interest? Can they be put to use in compositions? Sampled and _played_ on a drum pad? Can one find oneself at play in toxic waste?\n\nIn both the case of a river and of the recording of a river, the goal of a cleanup is to _make it as if the accident never happened_; even though it did. As the bizarre site in which toxicity thrived –red, ochre, violet, otherworldly– is relegated to memory, so is the ruinous mindlessness of contingency condemned to the desiccation of amnesia. In other words, how we got here is forgotten.\n\nSo in audio terms —again, letting how we treat sound be representative of how we treat nature and community— it must be useful, crucial even, to rehydrate the memory of this contingency, embodied in waste, and to play this waste like an instrument of its own, from a world of its own.\n","bn":"2:00","bs":"0","ap":"0","aq":"10","as":"484b147c-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"noise-reduction-artifacts.jpg","bp":"\nFormerly part of: Sound Library","aw":"42","ay":true,"bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"ba":"noise-reduction-artifacts","bb":"/noise-reduction-artifacts","bc":"1","bg":"noise-reduction-artifacts-sample-track-1","bh":true,"bi":"sound-library","bj":"Noise Reduction Artifacts Sample Track 1","bm":"Track"},{"ac":"HEM","ad":"/sound-library","ae":"noise-reduction-artifacts-sample-track-2.mp3","ag":"Twelve unique keyboard instruments made from frequencies removed by an industry-standard audio restoration plugin while cleaning up a noisy recording of a bubbling river.

As with the Flint River, byproducts can remain in the water long after the primary pollutants have been successfully extracted. Furthermore, if the toxic materials are successfully removed, something must be done with them. Can they be broken down into innocuous substances? Contained safely underground or above ground in drums? Made useful again in other industries? etc.\n\n~\n\nHere, too, we are cleaning up a river.\n\nIt is a river recorded in 1977 and pressed onto vinyl for a corny series of \"natural soundscapes\" marketed to a pop audience. The LP, having rotted away in a San Francisco second-hand store for god-knows-how-long, is not in the best condition. The audio is clouded and distorted; the vinyl clicking and popping, the equalisation is shot to hell, and the dynamics are flat and lifeless.\n\nThis audio needs cleanup.\n\nFor this, we'll use an algorithm very much like the MP3, an algorithm born from the bloodline of spectralist music, an algorithm embedded in a plugin widely used in the music industry on a daily basis for audio restoration, clarification of field recordings, and correction of flawed studio takes. (To avoid commercialisation, we'll not mention the name of this plugin.) We pipe the audio to our plugin, choose some equalisation settings, use a spectral window to create a fingerprint of the undesirable noises, click \"render\", and... bam!\n\nWe have successfully cleaned up this river.\n\nIf only it were so simple in Flint, in Norilsk, in so many other real rivers around the globe. But our audio work can bear upon our understanding of such places. How we treat sound can be representative of how we treat nature and communities. Sound is in nature; is nature, after all.\n\n~\n\nSo now we have a pristine (recording of a) river. But what we're interested in is not the results of our cleanup, rather the byproducts of our cleanup. We're interested in the \"audio toxic waste\" and what can and should be done with it. What happened to it? Where did it go? Unlike chemical waste, this audio waste probably just got deleted. Because it can just be deleted. But what if we held on to it? Allowed it to persist the way chemical waste persists? What can we do about it? What can we do with it? What can it do with us?\n\nIf spectral cleanup is the removal of portions of a visual representation of a sound, then are the removed frequencies a kind of mirror image of the world we desired to get by doing cleanup? Is this mirror image also a world? Does it contain a tonal system? Do the sounds hold any aesthetic or critical interest? Can they be put to use in compositions? Sampled and _played_ on a drum pad? Can one find oneself at play in toxic waste?\n\nIn both the case of a river and of the recording of a river, the goal of a cleanup is to _make it as if the accident never happened_; even though it did. As the bizarre site in which toxicity thrived –red, ochre, violet, otherworldly– is relegated to memory, so is the ruinous mindlessness of contingency condemned to the desiccation of amnesia. In other words, how we got here is forgotten.\n\nSo in audio terms —again, letting how we treat sound be representative of how we treat nature and community— it must be useful, crucial even, to rehydrate the memory of this contingency, embodied in waste, and to play this waste like an instrument of its own, from a world of its own.\n","bn":"2:00","bs":"0","ap":"0","aq":"10","as":"484b1480-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"noise-reduction-artifacts.jpg","bp":"\nFormerly part of: Sound Library","ay":true,"bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"ba":"noise-reduction-artifacts","bb":"/noise-reduction-artifacts","bc":"1","bg":"noise-reduction-artifacts-sample-track-5","bi":"sound-library","bj":"Noise Reduction Artifacts Sample Track 5","bm":"Track"},{"ac":"Julia Holter","ae":"claire-de-lune-whistled-julia-holter.mp3","ah":"tracks","ai":"17.09.2020","bn":"2:12","as":"484b1481-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"julia-holter.jpg","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"2","bg":"claire-de-lune-whistled-julia-holter","bi":"rare","bj":"Claire de Lune (Whistled)"},{"ac":"Jason Grier","ad":"http://www.facebook.com/nicestrangers/","ae":"jason-grier-on-nice-strangers-with-silvia-mal-silvia-mal.mp3","ah":"tracks","ai":"2017","bn":"24:28","as":"484b1482-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"nice-strangers.jpg","bp":"\nFormerly part of: Nice Strangers","aw":"33","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","be":"http://www.facebook.com/nicestrangers/","bf":"Nice Strangers","bg":"jason-grier-on-nice-strangers-with-silvia-mal-silvia-mal-jag","bh":true,"bi":"radio","bj":"Interview with Silvia Malnati"},{"ac":"Jason Grier","ad":"http://www.facebook.com/nicestrangers/","ae":"jason-grier-on-nice-strangers-with-silvia-mal-silvia-mal.mp3","ah":"tracks","ai":"2017","bn":"24:28","as":"484b1482-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561-2","av":"nice-strangers.jpg","bp":"\nFormerly part of: Nice Strangers","aw":"33","bu":"jag.rip","az":true,"bc":"1","be":"http://www.facebook.com/nicestrangers/","bf":"Nice Strangers","bg":"jason-grier-on-nice-strangers-with-silvia-mal-silvia-mal-jag","bh":true,"bj":"Interview with Silvia Malnati"},{"bl":"484a7852-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561\n484b626b-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561\n484b626c-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561\n484b626d-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561\n484b6274-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561\n484b6275-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561\n","ah":"playlists","ai":"January 2021","as":"c4614f76-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","av":"trauermusik.jpg","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", has-multiple-artists, in-overview-playlists","az":true,"bc":"1","bg":"trauermusik-festival","bi":"live, featured","bj":"Trauermusik Festival"},{"bl":"c4614f76-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ah":"label","ai":"17.09.2020","as":"484b1483-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"trauermusik.jpg","ay":true,"bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bg":"trauermusik-2009-1","bi":"events","bj":"Trauermusik Festival","bm":"Album Release"},{"ac":"Ariel Pink","ae":"ariel-orig-friedman-ariel-pink.mp3","ah":"tracks","ai":"2007","bn":"4:26","as":"484b1484-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"ariel-friedman.jpg","bp":"Formerly Ariel Friedman","aw":"8","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bd":"Ariel Friedman","bf":"(orig.

The set closes with Ariel Pink feigning dementia during a countdown of some vaguely defined \"rules\" for coping with a messed-up world and qualifying for inclusion in the band.","as":"484b6270-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"trauermusik.jpg","aw":"11","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bg":"spider-babies","bh":true,"bi":", featured, rare, live, ","bj":"Spider Babies"},{"ac":"Spider Babies","ae":"intro-spider-babies.mp3","ah":"tracks","ai":"2009","bn":"6:11","as":"484b6271-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"trauermusik.jpg","bp":"\nFormerly part of: Trauermusik Festival","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bg":"intro-spider-babies","bi":"live","bj":"Intro"},{"ac":"Spider Babies","ae":"we-re-just-tuning-up-spider-babies.mp3","ah":"tracks","ai":"2009","as":"484b6272-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"trauermusik.jpg","bp":"\nFormerly part of: Trauermusik Festival","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bg":"we-re-just-tuning-up-spider-babies","bi":"live","bj":"We're Just Tuning Up"},{"ac":"Spider Babies","ae":"we-re-not-doing-a-song-by-the-beetles-spider-babies.mp3","ah":"tracks","ai":"2009","as":"484b6273-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"trauermusik.jpg","bp":"\nFormerly part of: Trauermusik Festival","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bg":"we-re-not-doing-a-song-by-the-beetles-spider-babies","bi":"live","bj":"We're Not Doing a Song by The Beatles"},{"ac":"Spider Babies","ae":"this-girl-spider-babies.mp3","ah":"tracks","ai":"2009","bn":"2:12","as":"484b6274-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"trauermusik.jpg","bp":"\nFormerly part of: Trauermusik Festival","aw":"5","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"(feat.

I had never studied violin with another woman of color before so that appealed to me as well. India's pedigree extends far beyond her cosmic union with Sun Ra, but nonetheless this was the impetus for how she came to be my mentor and friend. Interestingly after playing under her tutelage for a few years, I still hadn't asked her how she came to play with Sun Ra until now. \n\nPerhaps that's because there is so much that India and I love to talk about: Aliens, ghosts, Halloween, crystals, scary movies, oppression, cats, pizza, etc. There is only so much these two chatty fire signs can cram into an hour and still practice scales! Or perhaps it's because stories only come forth when they are meant to be told, when the listener is integrated and ready to hear. Or when the querent finally asks...\n\nJeepneys: How did you come to work with Sun Ra?\n\nIndia Cooke: I was in a restaurant waiting for a plane, late night, watching the television. Johnny Carson was on. I'm just hanging out, waiting for a plane. And all of a sudden I see these extraordinary black folks piling in on the stage--all sorts of sparkling capes, headdresses, dancing and twirling, people doing cartwheels. I said, \"what the heck is this?\" They started carrying Sun Ra out on their shoulders like a Pharaoh. It was just extraordinary. And then they started playing music. The rhythm started and the music was otherworldly for sure. I said, \"I want to play that, I want to play with those people!\" I didn't even know who it was.\n\nJ: At that point had you started experimenting with weird jazz?\n\nIC: No. No way. I just saw this and something just hit me, like a bolt of renewing lightning! And that was that. That was that.  \n\nYears later, my very dear cat Sri, my first cat, a Blue Point Siamese, became very very ill. No doctors could figure out what was wrong with him. He had stopped using his left front arm. After awhile, it began to atrophy. I went back and forth to doctors and one doctor said amputation, and I said that's out of the question because first of all I knew that Sri was a warrior and he wouldn't have wanted it that way, and he also had a brother, Fleetwood Coupe de Ville, who would have freaked out. That's just the kind of relationship I had with these animals, we had a very deep relationship. So I take Sri to a different hospital, Berkeley Dog and Cat, and they too were scratching their heads. And here Sri is getting sicker and sicker. Now I am doing crystal work with him, putting crystals all around him at night and sleeping on the floor with him. I'm doing psychic dreaming and communication work with him, but still he doesn't get better. \n\nDuring this time, I see that Sun Ra is coming to Oakland and playing the \"Concept Cultural Gallery,\" a little train house in Jack London Square. Now you have to understand something about me, I am very shy. I NEVER would have thought in a zillion lifetimes that I could play with an avatar like Sun Ra. But when i heard that he was coming to town it was like the universal energy took over my whole being and told me \"you have to go and talk with Sun Ra. Sun Ra will save your cat.\" I know this sounds way off but I am telling you the honest truth. So, I went down to the venue on the day of the show with  my amp and violin. I have never done anything like this in my life. It was standing room only - I squeezed in. Here came intermission time. They were marching Sun Ra back to the green room. Everything was very ritual. I wrestled my way back there. I didn't know any of these guys. There was all sorts of press back there, everybody is trying to get back there, but I managed to knock on the door. And one of the musicians answered. I said, \"my name is India Cooke I play the violin and I need to speak with Sun Ra, my cat is very ill. (laughs) I didn't know what else to say that was the reason I was there.\"\n\nThey said OK, hold on. \n\nNext thing I know, they said, come on in, he'll speak with you. Everybody else had left to go start the second set. So I sit down in front of Sun Ra, sit down right on the floor and I began to just cry. And I said, Sir, my cat is very ill and I don't know what to do. I just got this feeling that I should come and speak to you. And I have my violin and I don't know if I should play for you here or play for him or what? And he looked at me like I was totally out of my mind, then he got up and left me sitting there in a pool of tears. He just got up and walked out. The door closed behind me in the green room. So I cleaned myself up and I got up and went out to the crowd to just listen to the rest of the set. I am there crowded with my little violin and amp next to a wall. Next thing I know, one of the musicians pushes his way through the crowd back to me and he says, \"Sunny wants you up front.\" I said, \"What?\" And he said, \"I'll take care of your amp and everything but Sunny wants you up front right next to him.\" And I said \"oh ok.\" I'm not even nervous, you've got to believe me, it was all driven by my cat. And so I go up and the drums start going, [makes drum noises] the rhythm was just so into the earth, it was back to the roots, it was all the way to the universe, you could just see the lights going all the way planetary! It was just incredible. And then Sun Ra looked at me and he said \"play, just play.\" I said, \"what you want me to play?\" And he said, \"play.\" And I started playing. And it was like I was the universe, we were the universe, we were all one. And Wisteria, one of the dancers, she was spinning like a whirling dervish all through the tables. And the music was rising and rising and it came to this extraordinary head. It was extraordinary. At the very end the folks went wild. Because of the music. And I thanked him so very much. I told them whenever you are back in town please let me know, I'll cook you dinner, thank you so much for letting me play. \n\nI go home to Sri and he is still ill, he is becoming quite lethargic. I take him one more time to Berkeley Dog and Cat and they said, \"Ok look, we'll try one more thing.\" They took him back for some time. Then somebody comes out and says, \"he's gonna be fine. We drilled a hole into the femur of his left arm the infection spewed out.\" Sri was fine.  \n\nTo this day I say, Sun Ra saved my cat. \n\nAnd that's how I got to play with Sun Ra. \n\nA few months down the road, I get a call, Sunny wants you to come to Europe with him.\n\nAnd that's how I got to come to tour and record with Sun Ra.\n\nAnd that's my story.\n\nJ: What was it like to tour with him?\n\nIC: I was one of the only women and traveling with essentially all men but I've got to tell you that the Arkestra were gentleman. And they had the utmost respect for Sun Ra. They never let him out of their sight. They made it clear that we were protecting him at all costs at all times so he couldn't be targeted by the media or whoever. There was a lot of love and good music. The music was really worldly. Sun Ra enjoyed playing with all kinds of musicians--african drummers, classical musicians, the whole gamut.\n\nI remember one time we were in Lyon, France, where we had been commissioned to do an orchestral work. So we go down to the symphony to rehearse. Here we are all these crazy looking black folks piling in for this orchestra rehearsal. The symphony musicians were seated there and it was obvious that didn't know how to greet this very special person named Sun Ra. He sits down at the piano. they're all waiting for the sheet music to be passed out to them so they can play the piece. But that's not how Sun Ra works. He sits down so that he was looking right at the orchestra, nodding his head, and then he turns back to the piano, pulls out manuscript paper and starts writing the parts right there.  He was custom writing the parts for this orchestra! He needed to feel and see it before he could do it.\n\nThe musicians started packing up and leaving. They had no idea.\n\nA few stayed. A couple flute players and wind players.\n\nThe ones who stayed, I'm sure are still talking about it to this day.\n\nJ: Those other guys weren't ready...\n\nIC: Absolutely. There was no connection, that's the way it should have been.\n\nJ: Are you still in touch with Arkestra members?\n\nIC: Some of those guys are still around, I went to see them play at Ashkenaz in Berkeley, Though there are so many new folks, it's hard to keep track. I stay connected by including them in my teachings: in my black music history class at Mills College. There is a cellist named Kash Killion, whom I am playing with at the Malcolm X Jazz Festival. Kash and I have played many many years together.\n\nJ: This May 22nd would have been Sun Ra's 98th birthday...if he were still alive what would you give him as a birthday gift?\n\nIC: Oh wow what would I get him for his birthday? I’d give him a cat like Sri. Sri was a hulk! Really, all muscle. He was gorgeous and he loved to dance.\n\nJeepneys is Anna Luisa Petrisko. Musician/artist/alien/timetraveler.

This isn’t officially a room; not your image of a writer’s hovel, a corner/garret/cellar that you escape to, that you’re driven into, in order to take down notes from the underground, promptings from the depths of an aged and anguished and angry soul. Where I am is the antidote to privacy and deprivation: I’m in a large cavernous industrial loft turned into an architects’ studio, and a disrumpled one at that -- each day this place is filled with 6-7-8 people, talking and arguing about streets and plazas and parks and gardens, bustling around from drawings to study models to computers. The place is like a rehearsal-hall for other places, far-flung places, a course of action from one table (‘Here we are in Dayton, Ohio’) to another (‘Here we are in Tokyo’). But the people who work here have left for the day, they’ve gone off to lives of their own, so I am alone; I’ve been left alone here, after hours, in an echoing loft/office/studio – it’s night, it’s dark, I’ve turned off all the lights but the one on my desk, I can’t see around the corner, around the bookshelves, where models could remind me of the world outside.\n\nIt’s just me and my music now...Well no, not exactly. I don’t have any music that I’ve made myself; I’m not a musician, not a composer. I take my music from others. Like everyone else, I have my CD’s; I’m old enough to have had records, of course, but I’ve thrown them all away by now, they were scratched up beyond recognition. I can’t take care of music; I could never hold records by their edges, never put records back in their sleeves, I let them pile up naked on the floor; I couldn’t treat records as precious jewels – they were instruments for use, and their deterioration proves that I used them, that I loved them. My records/ tapes/CD’s are my pets, non-living ones that I can mistreat without a second thought. Mistreatment might be purposeful; mistreatment might prove that I’ve committed them to memory and I don’t need them around anymore. I won’t keep scratchy records as artifacts of another time, as preservation and nostalgia; I’d rather remember that time, imperfectly, and impose this time onto it, I'd rather that this time interpret that time -- I can only live once, let me live now.\n\nI’m a consumer of music, not a producer...Well no, not exactly. Like everyone else, I sing now and then: my own songs, made-up songs -- the words simplistic Cole Porter, the music soured Kurt Weill, the tone a hybrid of Walter Huston and Mark E. Smith – but I sing them only to a person I’m sleeping with. The songs have the sound of intimacy – the a cappella voice, the whisper into the ear -- but they turn private space into public performance, like lovers singing to each other in an opera, in a musical. Music doesn’t express the self; it throws the self, like throwing your voice – it plays the self, like playing an instrument. My songs are born from the person I’m singing to, they’re about that person, they embody that person; but my song turns her into my voice, it reduces her to language, it stills her movement into sing-song rhymes, it cancels her out in puns.\n\nFor me music is a passive spectator sport, not an active participatory one...Well no, not exactly. It’s true, I can’t dance; that’s probably why I build: those who can, do, while those who can’t only write about it – people who can move their bodies dance, while people who are afraid to move build places for others to move in. But, though I don’t dance, I rock to music when nobody’s looking, I sway, I shake, I swoon, o yes I tremble --- the music might be over, but I’m moving to the song I can’t get out of my head, I’m moving at the commands of voices in my inner ear. A mystic sees things, while an insane person hears them; when you see something, you know exactly where it is, but when you hear something you can’t place where the sound is coming from – sound is all-over, there’s a wall of sound, the wall is tumbling down and sound comes over you in waves.\n\nSound is all over the studio. Music functions as wallpaper, as furniture; it fades into the background, and functions as background music for the design of spaces. Most of the time we don’t even know it’s on, until the disc-changer has run its course and the music stops, and we’re shocked, because we hear the silence; the music is there to fill the air, to make the air palpable, to be the air,. Now and then somebody pays attention and listens – ‘Shh...The muuu-sic, the muuu-sic!’ – and then music gets under your skin.\n\nAs soon as you realize you’re listening to music, the music is within you, with no transition between outside and inside, with no distinction between self and other. Music acts as a pulse; it collides with your pulse, and replaces your pulse, and breaks time up into rhythms. Music is an anthem, for a celebration or a revolution; in our case, it’s an anthem that goads design on: we work to the beat of different musics -- music marches us through a virtual space, a space in the mind and on paper and in model-form, into the physical place we’re designing for. But the music stops sometimes; nobody bothers, nobody takes the time to put on another CD...Well no, not exactly. It’s not that we don’t care; it’s that we care too much, we’ve listened too well, and music is too much to put up with. Music carves a space of its own, a self-enclosed volume within the room we’re inside of; the room recedes, and we’re caught in the prison-house of music, and we can’t get out. We want out.\n\nThe people in the studio have the run of the studio; everyone gets to play whatever he or she wants; the collaborative method of the studio, its democracy, its collision of ages and genders and ethnic backgrounds, is represented by music. But they have only ‘supermarket freedom’; their choices are limited by my limits, by the extent of my CD collection. I buy lots, play little – in any one time-period, say, ten to twenty CD’s that I resort to, that I depend on. Suddenly, somebody plays something I haven’t heard since I bought it, I haven’t heard since I played no more than the first two cuts before putting it to sleep forever: ‘Whose noise is that?...So I’m the culprit...Why has this come back to haunt me?...’ They bring in their own CD’s sometimes; as I hear this gift, this intrusion, this lesson, my stream-of-consciousness voice whispers: ‘Dario!’ ...’Peter!’... ‘Azarakhsh!’ I know who you are, and I hear what you like.\n\nMusic in the studio is as different as day and night. When people leave for the day, the music changes at night. During the day, we listen to the late 90’s and early 00’s: dance music, trance music, trip-hop, techno, electronica. There are no solo vocals in daylight;\n\na solo singer can’t hold the stage of the studio, the singer gets lost in the crowd. At night, when I’m alone here, I can be alone with a voice in my head: Leonard Cohen, Theresa Stratas, Charles Ives’ songs -- the singer speaks low to me. But I’m dozing off, I’m regressing, I’m coddling myself in the recorded person of another. Vocal music isn’t grown-up yet; it doesn’t have a life of its own, it’s still connected to the body of the producer -- vocal music is accompanied poetry, accompanied rhetoric, accompanied grammar. Grown-up music begins only when the voice ends, when your tongue is cut out and your body is replaced by an instrument, a machine, like a prosthetic device. Music begins to have a life of its own when you use/play-with/play something outside yourself, when the sound emitted from that instrument/machine is circulated through a room, or through a building, or through a city, like an electric current.\n\nThe music’s over now. The last person’s gone for the day, the CD-player’s been turned off, and I won’t turn it on again. Don’t push me. As long as music is on, the music’s inside me; but, in order to have an idea about music, I have to be outside music, I have to be without music. In order to think about music, I have to live in a condition of pre- music; if music fills the air, I have to empty the air. If I were a musician, I could reduce music into notes, into math, into numbers. I’m not a musician, but I can count as well as the next person: 1...2...3...4...Somebody stop me, or else I’ll go up to billions; hearing myself count proves that I’ve shut everything else out – I can count the silence.\n\n2.\nMusic made me; music told me to; my work has been accompanied by – my work as been programmed by – the pop music of its time.\nAt the end of the 60’s, at the beginning of my career in ‘art,’ my medium was my own body; art was a presentation of self, a face-to-face encounter between artist and viewer. The music I Ioved then was Van Morrison, Neil Young; the tone was rural, the voice was solo, the songs were long, twenty-minute songs: there room enough to drift through the country and find where you were, find out who you were –there was all the time in the world to build a cocoon for yourself and the person you sang to. (There was another music at the time, that came out of left field: the Velvet Underground. This was urban music, crowded music, that left no place to be safe in – this voice, too, was solo, but it was drowned out by instrumentation, driven to destruction – a song was long because time was relentless.)\n\nTimes changed; my work changed. By the mid-70’s, my medium had turned into you, the viewer: an exhibition-space was fitted out as a town square – there was nothing left of me but my audiotaped voice, that turned on viewers, and pushed them up against the wall. The music I loved then was the Sex Pistols, the Ramones: this was urban music, but it wasn’t victimized by the city, it turned the city on its head – the voice might be solo, but it was recorded too raw to be distinct, it dissolved into a mass voice that assaulted the listener, assimilated the listener -- the songs were cut short, two-minute songs, because a scream can’t maintain itself and still be a scream, a shout can’t last forever. (When I was writing texts for audiotapes then, I listened to songs and stole lyrics – Lou Reed, Brian Eno. I couldn’t make myself steal from fiction and poetry, because they were already down in black and white, as if for all time; but I could steal with impunity from words that had been turned into music, because I had to catch them as they went, catch them as I could -- as soon as I heard them they disappeared into thin air.)\n\nParadigms shifted. Since the end of the 80’s, my work has been converted to architecture; ‘Vito Acconci’ is dead – long live ‘Acconci Studio.’ We make places that blend into the rest of the city, only inside-out and upside down – places that flow from inside to outside, private to public, architecture to landscape, urban to rural, actual to virtual, and back again – places you carry with you, like a turtle. The music I love now is Tricky and Moby (but after five years of listening to them, they’ve already talked too much, I have to shut them out of my mind)...Once more, from the beginning: the music I love now is Vladislav Delay, Plasticman, Techno Animal, Matrix ...It’s a mix of the body-made and the machine-produced and the electronically generated, with no distinction from one to the other; it’s a mix of cultures, ‘world music’ brought home. This is dance music for dancing inside yourself. Its surface is continuous but at the same time tenuous and permeable; it melts into the space it’s heard in; it doesn’t push but instead insinuates; it functions as an undercurrent, it reduces itself to a pulse, it disintegrates – and disintegrates me – into particles.\n\n3.\nOnce upon a time I listened to ‘New (classical) Music.’ It was the mid-60’s; I was just out of school; I was a writer of fiction and poetry. Then I really did write alone in a room, as I’m doing again now – almost –writing these notes. Alone in the world of that room, I imported into it a world of music – Christian Wolf’s world, or Morton Feldman’s, or Pierre Henry’s. Each was a world in which every sound was distinct, precious, and so were the silences; sometimes sounds came from the world outside, from the everyday world, but these sounds were uprooted, stolen, so that they could be isolated inside a self- enclosed world. The sounds were points, that sometimes extended into a line, or grouped together into a square or a circle, the silence was a plane; there were so many points to attend to, and no topology to wander off in. ‘New Music’ was high- maintenance; it required constant attention. To be itself, ‘New Music’ had to preserve itself, I couldn’t take it with me, out into the world around me; I had to jump ship.\n\n4.\n- Why would a composer of music today sit alone in a room (as I’m sitting alone here now, writing this essay), at a piano, say, or at a computer, producing sounds and transcribing them into a notation system, when countless examples of recorded music are already there, waiting to be played – when hearing music is already the first step in producing music -- when sounds are all around us, in the streets and in the field -- when cheap and easy means are available to re-record and re-mix and re-shape that already recorded music and those already existent sounds?\n\n- Why would a musician today play notes on an instrument, when he/she could be playing along with already embodied music on a CD player, when he/she could be playing louder or softer than the recorded music, and faster or slower than the recorded music, and playing that recorded music backwards...? Why would that musician today play that instrument at all, when he/she could be playing already recorded music on a CD player, and raising or lowering the volume of that music, and changing the speed of that music, and playing that music backwards...?\n\n- Why would a listener today come to a concert hall and be part of an audience of music, when you can hear music anytime you want to, inside your own home? Why would a person come to a place for music when music is placeless, when you can take it with you wherever you want, when you can listen to it while walking, driving, exercising? Why would people come inside a concert hall and then close their eyes in order to hear the music better? What do concert-goers want? What are you doing here anyway?\n\n- Where does the proper music -- the right music, the characteristic music, the appropriate music, the necessary music, the desired music, the only-dreamed-of music -- come from? It does not fall from the skies; it does not rise up from under ground; it only happens somewhere in between, and you are there.","ak":"articles","as":"ce0793ee-d0d8-4ffd-9740-718392ab0f4d","av":"words-before-music-vito-acconci.jpg","aw":"1","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", home-features","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Vito Acconci","bg":"words-before-music-vito-acconci","bh":true,"bi":"featured, artistic-labor","bj":"Words Before Music"},{"ac":"Julia Holter","ah":"articles","ai":"January 2021","aj":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJulia Holter\n\n“For composition is not an act of writing, it is rumination, cogitation, dictation, a listening and a dialogue, a ‘gathering’ (collectio) of voices from their several places in memory” (198 Mary Carruthers, The Book of Memory)\n\nWhen we start writing, we start hearing new things. The void that exists between the word and its sounding is explored best in various investigations into the experience of memory. So, the most useful work for us deals with memory. Keeping in mind the medieval word image of the collatio/collectio/colligere,  we explore the experience of the writer of any time period as individual voice (part) and as universal voice(whole), and track the movement of the documented voices towards one another. The voice begins from many points before it reaches an infinite and universal voice, and here we will consider both situations in which the voice immediately blends in with others, and situations in which the voice is outwardly individual. \n  Medieval western manuscript culture provided endless illuminations of monks/scribes writing/taking dictation.  In these works, the monk/scribe writes on parchment with his knife and quill. Objects besides an occasional desk or seat around him tend to be somewhat otherworldy and/or symbolic, including, most frequently, some sort of ‘voice of God’ from above—a bird, or an angel—dictating into the scribe’s ear. From a modern standpoint, the illuminations are strange sort of self-referentials—a concrete drawing of the basic situation of the act of drawing, all encased within images of birds and angels.  What is the interest in repeatedly capturing these moments in the same particular way? What does this tradition say about the writer/the creator’s voice? (It seems unclear if there is a distinction being made between dictation and creation, because monks both copied and wrote, and it does not seem that the pictures made were intended to be seen as self-portraits.)  If it is like a graphic signature, the image itself is still disconnected from the scribe who drew it by the fact that drawing is not a direct representation of that individual, only to one similar in function (and sometimes a specific other one). One illumination, MS. R.17.I from Cambridge, Trinity College, claims that it was “once assumed to be a self-portrait” (78 illumnated manuscripts), but that instead it is a celebration of a monk of the past. It could be argued, however, that this “commemoration” of “the monk Eadwine, the prince of scribes” is, in fact, a kind of self-portrait—that the self here is not the individual self, but it is becoming a universal scribe self. That a manuscript would so commonly hold these isolated memory images of scribes writing amidst the book’s unrelated text, brings attention to the creator of the written word. \nThis connection of the voice to the text is not strange even in the context of the time period, where historians/writers discuss a resurgence in the classical “art(s) of memory”, which worked with techniques of the senses: “Memoria unites written with oral transmission, eye with ear, and helps to account for the highly ‘mixed’ oral-literate nature of medieval cultures that many historians of the subject have remarked”  (122 Carruthers).  What is interesting about studies of the medieval “art of memory” is that it is called an “art” (or “arts”)— it acknowledges itself as an art constructed in order to assist the arts. The goal of these techniques unclear—in antiquity, memory study was an Aristotelian “art” method manipulating the mysteries of mind memory to bring order to such human activities as rhetoric (“Aristotle gave a philosophical explanation for using arbitrary associations as a basic mnemonic tool” (123 carruthers)). But by the Middle Ages, many of the “ars memorativa” writings have misinterpreted the writings of their classical predecessors, and the “art” has been manipulated to apply to its time: “In the early Middle Ages, memoria is discussed most often not in the context of rhetoric but rather in writings on meditation and prayer, in which a diagram-like ‘picture’ is created mentally which serves as the site for a meditational collatio, the ‘gathering’ into one ‘place’ of the various strands of a meditational composition” (123 Carruthers). Carruthers quotes Augustine’s (who lived around the fall of the Roman Empire and the beginning of the Middle Ages) new emphasis on the present human situation as a sole basis for developing some art of memory: “It is clear that Augustine [who lived around the fall of the Roman Empire] assumed that the way to God lay only through the re-presenting of his past in memory; he has no interest in his past except as it provides him with a way and ground for understanding his present”  (193 Carruthers).  So the difference between this art of memory (according to Carruther’s) and that of antiquity seems to lie in differing conceptions of the role of current time and current space, with the classical period’s “art of memory” using the past to aspire toward a future in a new room, and the medieval’s looking in all time/space directions, always from its present center. \nHow do we identify which things fit best into our present? The notion of the malleable recollection as fittest recollection is one response: in Matter and Memory, Henri Bergson argues that the chosen recollections are the ones with the most potential of fitting into our current time/place (“a less complete recollection, one that is less complex, where it is in reality a recollection less dreamed, more impersonal, nearer to action and, therefore, more capable of molding itself…upon the new character of the present situation“  (241 Bergson)). Why do we need it to be “less dreamed”? Because we have to be able to make something of it relevant for ourselves. In Mnemosyne, Holderlin provides us with a “we” voice and a meandering list of  “we’s” unrelated (and mythical) event recollections. Is it not a familiar feeling, the impulse to pull the situations of far-away/long-ago myths into our own local/now? Holderlin seems to be illustrating the obsessive human impulse to bring as many suitable past events under its formal wing as possible. \nSo, with a malleable recollection, there is a focus on the present, and a unification of time and space. Can we identify physical characteristics of this mysterious unified time/space? Inspired by the outward force of the Holderlin stream of memories, we could consider the energies—that isolation of recollections cannot be imposed, and the choosing is an active ‘exothermic’ process. Bergson uses a sort of energy formula to answer the question of why things are isolated by what one could call this ‘exothermic’ process. He answers that the body itself will always pursue the things which will keep it active: “it is toward action that memory and perception are turned; it is action that the body prepares…so the memory of a living being appears indeed to measure, above all, its powers of action upon things and to be only the intellectual reverberation of this power” (228 Bergson).\nAs before, this idea might be seen more clearly by imagining where it does not exist. Something physical happens, in nostalgia, where the present is lost completely, as well as the independence of the thing formed.   “He who lives in the past for the mere pleasure of living there, and in whom recollections emerge into the light of consciousness without any advantage for the present situation, is hardly better fitted for action: here we have no man of impulse, but a dreamer” (153 Bergson). Bad energy and “dreamers” connect also in a 1986 interview with composer Robert Ashley; he senses trouble with some nostalgic “energy”: “Memorizing is used for one thing. Reminiscence is used for another thing, and imagination is used for another, and when you get something that wants to cross over, you immediately reject it. Everybody hates to be around people who live in a dream and keep telling the same story all the time ” (114 The Guests)\nThis physical action manifests itself in visualizations too, and ultimately reconnects again to all the senses. The medieval turn away from previous goal-oriented craft, and toward an active presence and an image of unification is echoed broadly in Roland Barthes’ 1972 dissatisfaction with classical music performance culture in The Grain of the Voice: “The ‘grain’ is the body in the singing voice, in the writing hand, in the performing limb” (276 Barthes). Here, the voice and the writing hand are visualized together, and we can recall again the process of the scribes: “Three fingers write, two eyes see, the whole body works” (anon. scribe, 11th century).  \nVisualization of the voice plays a large part in the musical score, expanding the imagination, as art of memory writers point out, and allowing more space for memory. In Medieval Music and the Art of Memory Berger discusses the same architectural mnemonic devices as used in classical rhetoric, used to build and experience one’s musical structures: “this structure of four stories functions both as a depository of things that one remembers and as a place through which one wanders while composing” (218 berger) Interestingly, this discussion of the art of memory’s role in medieval music remains more of a technical-skill variety: “There are two areas where visualization might have played an important role. First, the ability to visualize the staff allowed composers to work out polyphonic pieces in the mind without a wax tablet or parchment. And second, polyphonic compositions were sung by heart. Thus they needed to be clearly structured so that they could be remembered. I believe that periodic articulation might been so popular because it allowed one to structure and visualize long compositions in the mind” (199-200 Berger). Berger cites a Machaut motet (Tu gui gregem tuum ducis) in which the limited amount of information makes it evident that the performers knew the chant by heart: “in Machaut’s motet Tu gui gregem tuum ducis/Plange regni respublica/Tenor:Apprehende arma et scutum et exurge talea IV and color 3 of the tenor are notated in two manuscripts only by the words ‘Apprehende arma’” (213 Berger). \nBut, once again we are dissatisfied with such a dry explanation of music. Strong documented opinions about the role of these visualizations helps shake things up a bit, and bring back to us the idea of the unified present.  The French author Elias Salomonis describes the experience (negatively) of listening and watching singers perform with notation in 1274:  \n“The written page might have triggered the memory of the melodic and rhythmic outline of the piece, a piece that the performers already knew:… ‘[Concerning the laity] They scarcely deign at times to perform plainchant at its proper pace when they sing by anticipating, accelerating, retarding, and improperly phrasing the notes…this [writing of notes] is done for the ornament and beauty of the notes on the page: for seeing, not for singing. Let them know this for certain, not inquiring whether the [practices] that they see are ours, rather than God’s, or proper to the art of music (of which they are ignorant). But experimenting, they sing ‘meow, meow’ into the air, so that a stranger may turn up and listen’” (196 Berger).    Just as it is amusing to see how medieval writers completely re-/mis-interepreted the classical idea of art of memory, it is to see Elias decide upon the idea that notation was not at all functional. But this point is worthy of discussion, because is it not true that the visual does not function merely as a direction? In Berger’s writing, the aesthetics of the score are not discussed much otherwise. \n          Is there something of the independent power of the voice/sound that Elias is getting at that is lost with writing? Carruthers discusses how writing silences the “personal” voice, and what she sees as a unique physical power of the “auditory world”:  \n“When words are written, they become of course, a part of the visual world. Like most of the elements of the visual world, they become static things and lose, as such, the dynamism which is so characteristic of the auditory world in general, and of the spoken word in particular. They lose much of the personal element, in the sense that the heard word is most commonly directed at oneself, whereas the seen word most commonly is not, and can be read or not as whim dictates. They lose these emotional overtones and emphases …Thus, in general, words, by becoming visible, join a world of relative indifference to the viewer—a world from which the magic ‘power’ of the word has been abstracted” (Carothers 20).\n\nThe frequent placement of sound over meaning may be what makes much music/sound art so clearly independent from the maker, ultimately, and this idea brings us back to Roland Barthes’ “geno-song”. The senses become crucial when our creations become so physical and independent from us.  By themselves, field recordings of artists' performances at once freeze the voices documented in time/place but also open up new situations by illuminating something previously unheard about the voices. In Jerome Rothenberg’s ethnopoetic soundings collection, there are many recorded pieces that could potentially fit with his collaborator George Quasha’s quote “The maker is actually in the position of reader” (Alcheringa Volume Three, Number Two, 1977).  In recordings of musicians, as as the collections of Jerome Rothenberg “ethnopoetics” sounds Celtic Mouth Music, sounds are important and “meaning” is not: \"Puirt-a-beul (= mouth music) are lyrics written primarily for dancing to. Consequently the lyrics are only of secondary importance – the rhythm in the song is the most important aspect and the rhythm takes precedence over the rhythm and stresses of the Gaelic.”  In Robert Ashley’s “Automatic Writing”, the sound may induce a stronger visualization of two people, for lack of linguistic clarity. Listening to the piece is a visceral experience—meaning is completely obscured by inability to decipher what is said; the human sounds taken out of their functional contexts are either muted or awkwardly loud, and yet somehow the fragmentation builds its own meaning, without the structure we assume we need—Barthes’ “’truth’ of language, not its functionality (clarity, expressivity, communication)”  (272 Barthes). \nPerhaps the place to land in the exploration of the voice in space/time is with the pure infinite voice—the lament vessel, coming from nowhere.  In music, the lament takes the form of a simple and relatively short vocal composition that is about one sad idea. These pieces over time have been extracted from their operas/larger works and lived independently, making people cry.  Structurally, they are all similar. Lyrics are always simple and concerning loss (compare in attached paper), whether in love or in religion. Instrumental accompaniment is general uncomplicated against the melodic line, if not completely repetitive: both Claudio Monteverdi’s Lamento della Ninfa and Henry Purcell’s Dido’s Lament are in the form of a ground-bass aria, with a consistent descending tetrachord bass ostinato. In the case of the Mozart, there are many voices, which does not seem to change the general affect much. If anything, this points to the interchangeability of the individual and the collective voice. \nSo we encounter many colligeres, gatherings of voices, in whose component parts, exist their own gatherings.

The early 2000's were the swingin' glitch years, when clicking, skipping, beat-repeat and buffer-delay seeped into every ontological stratum of music-making.\n\nBut it wasn't just flashy winks teased into indie pop-dance, facile quasi-classical crossover, and bookish sound art. Glitch was a grand, sweeping sea-change in how people listened to recorded music. The idea that the act of editing was now elemental, unconcealed; that seems to be the legacy of experimental electronica's golden years.\n\nAnd at the heart of it all seemed to lie this curious little album by Ekkehard Ehlers, made of nothing more nor less than mashups of two of the previous century's musical sea-changers, Arnold Schönberg and Charles Ives. A high concept, even for haughty times. Not exactly the stuff of poetical dreams, right?\n\nBut in the decade to follow, Ehlers would become well-known for balancing the heart precariously upon the intellectual sword. In his follow-up to Betrieb, the \"Ekkehard Ehlers Plays\" series, the works of Cornelius Cardew and Albert Ayler were brought to bear upon a new tradition that had yet to figure out how it felt about feeling. While before it, as any proper first album should, Betrieb could have no better stated this mission of pitting concept against intuition. To this day, Betrieb continues to articulate the epistemology of its era, as much as it offers timeless auditory delights.\n\nHEM's 24bit remaster represents a significant update to the original sound. The original masters were transferred to 1/2\" tape, and then treated to a remarkable journey through hand-wound patch cables, bespoke acoustics, and humming transistors.\n\nEhlers' music not only stands up to the analog treatment, it shines: Clicks and pops have become fuzzy glowing points of starlight, while once-foggy atmospherics have become layered, multidimensional skeins of strings and smoke.\n\nBetrieb was once the thinking-person's feeling-music (or the feeling-person's thinking-music). But it is now, simply, a transportive listening experience.\n","as":"f47f4800-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"betrieb.jpg","aw":"7","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Ekkehard Ehlers — April 1, 2013","bg":"betrieb-ekkehard-ehlers-press-release","bj":"Betrieb Press Release"},{"bl":"c4617685-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Using personal deconstructions of amateur soul music as a skeleton, Grier fleshed out nods to Kosmiche, 70′s Eno, Janet Jackson and Jodeci, Terry Riley, drone music, renaissance organ music, and medieval composers like Petrus de Cruce and Josquin des Prez.","ah":"press-releases","ai":"April 2012","aj":"***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nClouds: Jason Grier\n\n***Formats***: Streaming/Digital/2xCD/2xLP (with download card)<br>\n***Release Date***: June 19, 2012<br>\n***Cat.

Mad Criminale\n\n***About Clouds***\n\nClouds is a little novella of an album; a sphinx-like meditation on fate, circumstance and the oddities of being a perpetual traveller. Fittingly, it was recorded in three years and three cities; between 2009 and 2011 in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Berlin. Grier carried the drafts around like a travelogue, and the resulting compositions read like an accumulation of curiously juxtaposed sounds and notes-to-self about the fickle nature of fate.\n\nUsing personal deconstructions of amateur soul music as a skeleton, Grier fleshed out nods to Kosmiche, 70′s Eno, Janet Jackson and Jodeci, Terry Riley, drone music, renaissance organ music, and medieval composers like Petrus de Cruce and Josquin des Prez. He first crafted an original set of grooves, then deleted beats and notes until just-so-little of the original syncopation could be felt. In the resulting void, he sought out hovering musicologies emerging like clouds in tension with nothingness.\n\nIn \"Karma\", the gorgeously sparse duet with Julia Holter, the void is filled by one of the album's many field recordings, sourced from a badly scratched \"soothing sounds of nature\" record found in a San Francisco thrift store. The vinyl hiss creates a double-irony, but more importantly serves as a kind of \"springtime mist\" where the tensions nothing/ something, sure/ unsure, and I-love-you/ I-love-you-not come in and out of focus. Grier composed the vocals following a medieval technique where a single melody is traded between performers. The result is a love poem that may or may not belong to the same heart, that may be spoken by indifferent voices, or by two people of one mind.\n\nContrast this to the title track, where bubbling, fizzing energy propels a sardonic exchange between a hapless dreamer (Grier) and a hip stoner (portrayed by Lucrecia Dalt). The dreamer can never convince the stoner that doing what comes natural is extraordinary. But ultimately, both agree \"that all you really ever need is in the sky\" —be it a sky filled with dreams or smoke.\n\nBetween \"Karma\" and \"Clouds\", sits ecclesiastical funk ballad, \"The Rules\". Here Grier claims that fate isn't our maker; it's just a hitchhiker riding our lives to some far off place. The song's A-B-A structure, with a deadpan verse repeat after 4 minutes of tantric buildup, echoes its theme of eternal return. This probably best sums up the movement of Clouds. We get nervous peering at the void (which is always the true form of \"what comes next\") even though we're certain to encounter something familiar. You keep meeting the same souls over and over again. And it's quite nice.\n","as":"f47f9620-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"clouds.jpg","aw":"11","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Jason Grier – June 19, 2012","bg":"clouds-jason-grier-press-release","bj":"Clouds Press Release"},{"bl":"c4610154-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"With her sophomore full-length, Lucrecia Dalt leaps into a surrealist landscape with stunning abandon, eschewing the comparatively safe tropes and song structures of her previous work.

Batholith\n\n***About Commotus***\n\nToday, we seem to have two branches in the school of experimental pop. One branch privileges object-hood, richness of surface, and mass-hallucinatory quotation. The other (much less celebrated) branch seeks to recapture authenticity in the form of a highly personal hallucination of music history.\n\nWith her sophomore full-length, Lucrecia Dalt follows the latter branch as far as it seems to go. She leaps into a surrealist landscape with stunning abandon, eschewing the comparatively safe tropes and song structures of her previous work. And she charts a surprisingly inventive and rewarding territory in the process. Much as it is with her newfound contemporaries at HEM Berlin, for Dalt, solitude and assemblage (of sound, genre, musicology, technique) is an exploratory zone steered toward the inner universe. To follow the music, one must be prepared to make this trip as real as sound itself.\n\nThemes of agitation and disturbance, cumulative, impending and scalable, propel Commotus, and create a framework for understanding its emotional spectra. The music lives in the contradiction between having time to reflect on the inevitable, and the irrevocability of its outcome. \n\nDalt, who is a civil engineer with a specialty in geotechnics, knows that motion on a geologic time scale can be the most poignant analogy to the interminable struggle between self-awareness and sea change.\n\nThe album opens with a Saltación. An English speaker's mind might mistake a bit of wordplay here, as if this opening statement were a \"salutation\". It seems like a proper greeting enough, with a ceremonious gong resounding behind a chorus of liquid angels and transistor-organ castanets. In fact, Saltación is a geological process that occurs within sand dust, a repeated movement that ultimately accumulates to enormous scale. It is with this timeless notion of the enormity of change that Dalt greets us.\n\nEscopolamina is a drug that erases memory temporarily. It is commonly used in Dalt's birth country, Colombia, to steal things on the streets. Escopolamina causes the victim to lose total will for minutes so as to give their belongings up voluntarily. The song's sneaky tango metre creeps over a metronomic click-track, as if to mock the experience of lost time.\n\nIn Turmoil, she reveals her new approach to music as well as any other track. She intones \"long, lasting, filthy, seeking...\" at once mantra-like and languid. Here she shows that she is as unafraid to approach ambivalent concepts as she is dramatic tension. She says, \"I've been doing deals with the devil, you should have been aware of all this fire.\" Forestalling the call's response until Esplendor, four tracks later, she proclaims \"Well you see, no, you don't see, your unforgivable sins don't allow you to see my splendor \"mi splendor\", but somehow in my fostered idiocy, I am born, you know me, well, you knew me well! You knew me well until today.\"\n\nIn Batholith, it all comes to a head: \"Let me brake your ecstasy my love, you forgot that I don't obey to your linear truth. You forgot that I have the felsic spring powers, surprise surprise, I'll disrupt your narrative and alter your flattened landscape, sorry about that.\" The love story of a batholith spring that reshapes our predictable ground. Or the Deleuzean thought of geological time: Something can spring from the depths and change our narratives, our perception of reality and we are somehow obliged to continue with this new appearing, deal with it, or suffer from it.\n\nDalt has established herself as a solo performer, building songs live and in recordings using pedals, laptop, and loops. So it's all the more surprising that, throughout Commotus, she works with an enormous, and enormously subtle, sound palette, almost completely triggered from solo bass. (Two notable exceptions being guest appearances from Luke Sutherland and Julia Holter.) \n\nSome of these sounds are as concrete as a timpani shot, or the snap of an analog rhythm box. But the majority of sounds exist in a nether-world between evocation and pure abstraction. This is rife terrain for self-expression, and dramatic tension, with a result made all the more poignant because she's playing alone. In Commotus, you can hear every sound event becoming the curled-up dimensions of a richly personal experience.\n","as":"f47fbd30-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"commotus.jpg","aw":"12","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Lucrecia Dalt — June 19, 2012","bg":"commotus-lucrecia-dalt-press-release","bj":"Commotus Press Release"},{"bl":"c4614f71-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"\"Demonstration Disc\" is, ostensibly, a new album by Human Ear Music creator Jason Grier; \nequally  so,  it’s  a  quickstart  guide  to  the  sonic  offerings  in  an  open-sourced  collection  of \nsamples and generative music tools.","ah":"press-releases","ai":"August 2017","aj":"\n\n***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nJason Grier: Demonstration Disc\n\n***Formats***: Streaming/Digital (with 1.39 Gb Sound Library)<br>\n***Release Date***: October 6, 2017<br>\n***Cat.

Loud, decadent, irreverent, and cinematic, \"Demonstration Disc\" sounds like mashing down all the preset buttons on your sparkling-new, cosmic-avant-garde monster synth, with delectable aplomb.\n\nThe track titles, simply numbers 1 thru 10, wink at the idea that this is a generic test suite, but also belie the thematic and political undertones of the album, composed largely in Berlin and Amsterdam, in November 2016, on the brink of, and during the aftermath of the US presidential elections.\n\nSounds range from the lushly psychoacoustic –hundreds of guitar harmonics woven together into gossamer threads, panoramic field recordings of Berlin’s raucous New Year’s Eve fireworks– to the non-cochlear; for example, outtakes, gaffes, and editing remnants preserved as artifacts of artistic labor; as well as rips of Facebook video feeds of mass-protests following the US election of Donald Trump, so mangled by a slow NY–Berlin internet connection as to converge upon what is stereotypically diagnosed as “noise music“. But this is neither distinctly noise, nor music as such, even in its deployment at the end of the album’s penultimate track.\n\nMusically, Demonstration Disc furthers the approach taken by Grier on 2013’s \"Unbekannte\", described as \"a series of mysterious short films\", by Julia Holter —who makes a cameo appearance on track 6, whistling a sliced-up <i>Au Clair de la Lune</i>. Unlike \"Unbekannte\", which was largely hand-edited, Grier’s sound-monoliths on Demonstration Disc are machine-tooled by his often unpredictable \"generative playback engine\", a sample-dot sprayer which he jokingly named \"Seurat MIDI\".\n\nThe resulting assemblies of sound are more complex and dense, sprawling for their relatively small running times, and almost illegibly detailed at times. For example, track 6’s coruscated vault of sound consists of sleigh bells, squiggly noise-reduction artifacts, and high notes from a 150-year old, wood-rotted piano Grier discovered in a Tuscan villa.\n\nThe album is, nonetheless, part of a larger project which includes the \"open-sourcing\" of Grier’s sound library, the mainstay of his long-duration performances since 2013, comprising more than 1800 audio samples, plus the Seurat MIDI engine. Not only are the sounds and the tools freely available, Grier even provides tutorials and has planned expansion packs, making this act of framework development into the larger artwork itself.\n","as":"f4800b50-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"demonstration-disc.jpg","aw":"2","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Jason Grier — October 6, 2017","bg":"demonstration-disc-jason-grier-press-release","bi":"past, releases","bj":"Demonstration Disc Press Release","bk":"Demon&shy;stration Disc Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612865-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Haunted Graffiti wasn’t the first time a bedroom-cloistered Ariel Pink revolutionized his own sound and persona by taking to the stage with a band.

Never have Gary’s imaginary girlfriends been so numerous and charismatic. They are shuffled around in a number of combinations, scenes and poses, sometimes confronting each other, traveling in wooded dreams, or warming up their mental homes. Their names are blurted out like elements of an abstracted lexicon, and the effect is strangely introspective.\n","as":"f480f5b0-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"lisa-wants-to-talk-to-you.jpg","aw":"14","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Gary Wilson — November 24, 2008","bg":"lisa-wants-to-talk-to-you-gary-wilson-press-release","bj":"Lisa Wants To Talk To You Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612863-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"A glimpse into Julia Holter's experimental pop series \"Translations\".","ah":"press-releases","ai":"April 2014","aj":"***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nJulia Holter: Maria\n\n***Formats***: Streaming/Digital/7\" Vinyl (with download card)<br>\n***Release Date***: June 3, 2014<br>\n***Cat.

Instantly it was a black night; rain..._<br>\n— _Walter Benjamin, dream transcription from \"Das Buch der Träume\"_</small>\n\nIf not by accelerating global crises and surreal election cycles in the west, late-2016 may have been marked, historically, as the moment of \"peak TV\", when binge-watching immersive Netflix offerings for hours on end produced the opioid mindstate of a waking dream _en masse_.\n\nIn her solo debut, Copenhagen’s Line Gøttsche Dyrholm —violinist, CalArts MFA student, and alumna of Danish electronic popband Belle Ville— furnishes a nearly perfect anti-partner to our streaming video panem et circenses. Omonia’s 28 minutes of delicate piano and bare vocals feels immersive and epic, fractured and dreamlike, yet anything but soporific.\n\nGøttsche’s voice guides us gracefully and all-too-swiftly through a series of disjointed fin-du-siècle set pieces, her narration smoothing out the incongruities —partial staircases to nowhere, french doors opening onto ivy-draped brick walls, an asymptotic woodland twilight in which the sun never quite sets— both sketching out and soundtracking a kind of \"Last Year at Marienbad\" world. Tempered flourishes of classical and jazz instruments accompany her drifting piano sonorities, which sound at times straight from the late-romantic playbook (Satie, Debussy, and the final works of Franz Liszt come to mind). On repeated listens, however, the vocal lines prove to be a brittle leader, seemingly stitched together from some long-lost narrative thread, the paeans and barbs of an inflationary love, and the bitter arc toward its chauvinistic decline: A shadow-play of heroism, computerized bodies and ameliorating houseplants. Over the course of Omonia’s five sections, allusions and metonymies recur and efface each other’s meanings; fragile sentence fragments coalesce and diverge again.\n\nThe performativity of words and decadent asceticism is decisive, and timely. Gøttsche’s low-tech invocation of cognitive dissonance, heightened sensitivity, and circular memory finds itself squarely in the midst of our amnesiac age of digital alienation and artificial dreams. But Omonia comes across as neither a coy sarcasm nor a trenchant critique, rather, something quite original and strange; sincere and surreal in equal measure.\n","as":"f4816ae0-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"omonia.jpg","aw":"3","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Line Gøttsche — November 25, 2016","bg":"omonia-line-gottsche-press-release","bi":"past, releases","bj":"Omonia Press Release"},{"bl":"c4614f74-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"The tracks selected for _Scared Famous_ were all recorded at a key moment in Pink's recording adventure, dating back to, or immediately following the recordings on \"House Arrest.\"","ah":"press-releases","ai":"August 2017","aj":"***FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE***\n\nAriel Pink's Haunted Graffiti: Scared Famous\n\n***Formats***: CD-R<br>\n***Release Date***: August 21, 2007<br>\n***Cat.

Pink's songwriting powers seems to have taken a leap, stealing the show from his trademark tape-texture aesthetics and begging for appreciation in their own right.\n\nFor the first time in his grand recording adventure, you hear Ariel Pink's music evoking a bygone era, not because of the fuzz and hiss of delapidated tape, but because you just can't believe anybody can write songs like this anymore.\n\nAppropriately then, this release comes just as Ariel has begun playing out with a six piece band consisting of local Los Angeles musicians, leaving his karaoke-tape days behind.\n","as":"f48191f0-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"scared-famous.jpg","aw":"15","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","bc":"1","bf":"Ariel Pink — August 21, 2007","bg":"scared-famous-ariel-pink-press-release","bj":"Scared Famous Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612864-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Lucrecia Dalt treats listeners to a perilously brief, intricately conceived meditation.

Mirage\n\n***I: An Invitation to Divide***\n\nSyzygy begins with a simple provocation enough: \"Are you in a hurry?\" But if Lucrecia Dalt intends to provoke, then her invitation leads to a radically unexpected denouement. For Dalt does, indeed, lead us. But where she leads us is to a kind of Ursprung of beautiful distress. Syzygy is a notion which Dalt poetically amplifies by giving emotional depth to the astrophysical concept of a point of conjunction and opposition. No place is this, and no whole thing can exist here. In contrast to her contemporaries, Dalt's second opus sees her become more the Charon than the chanteuse, reminding us that complicatedness, dialectic, and radical alterity are what really forged the axle of creation. For Dalt, Syzygy is a state of eternal oscillation that effervesces from the sand and levitates like a mirage.\n\nSyzygy is also an aftermath (maybe the scene following the ineluctable march of the cloud of dust that loomed on the cover of last year's Commotus); an infernal aporia filled with syntactic ambiguity and indeterminable potential. And Syzygy, indeed, plays up that previous album's game of getting you right on Dalt's level; of having to learn her aesthetic language before you can even ask what's her statement. But unlike Commotus, which required you to adjust your eyes to subtle contrasts of scale and temporality in order to wink at the portentousness of it all, Syzygy strikes quickly, like an arrow shot into the night of Dalt's perceptual domain.\n\n***II: The Devil's Staircase***\n\nEvery sound on Syzygy is a trace in darkness. Dalt has refined her palette with microscopic acuity, made it glimmer with hidden tension and uncertainty, and layered it with bristling moments of surrealism and tragicomic suspense. The sounds of Syzygy cling so closely to their ideologic roots that it could well be the quintessential thought-forms album: Rapid-pulse arpeggios fluttering on the edge between beautiful texture and unhinged counterpoint. Deep, compelling drones flowing onward like a slow river through candlelight. Unbearably sharp prickles and ungrounded loops springing up like uncertain stars, or sparks not yet to fuse into higher being. It's hard not to make a comparison to the zoo of elementary particles, or a space age sound library; Except the album advances forward with such inexorable cohesiveness that its brevity comes as the most electric shock of all.\n\nIn this time, Syzygy treats the listener to an intense —almost Webernian— series of micro-climaxes that ratchet you up a devil's staircase. You climb through tension after tension, before falling deep into drone and/or punch-drunk reverie. And the point of entry is just as jagged: After the relatively sanguine trip of _Glossolalia_ —with its theme of senseless language and un-becoming serving as an oddly beguiling welcome— we are dropped straight into the density of _Inframince_, a bass-on-bass counterpoint of oscillator and 808 with vocals skipping randomly between Spanish, Catalan and English. This striking piece is, in fact, a setting of Duchamp's notion of our most undefined moments, like the infinitessimal airspace between two bodies locked in embrace, the warmth remaining in a chair when the sitter has long vanished, or the unthinkably thin region between a levitating mirage and the ground. After _Inframince_'s mounting climax —in which Dalt splits herself quite literally in three, so that she can ricochet around the stereo field like a deleterious phantom— we are left with nowhere to go but the weary pastorale of sepia-toned finger-plucking, drifting Kubrickian in deoxygenated space.\n\nThe move is repeated with _Vitti_. _Syzygy_'s fractured heart goes here at 600bpm, an arpeggiated dervish that simply has nowhere to rest. Dalt's would-be wail is squelched by some kind of tornado leaving her voice crushed and hushed, tonally and ideologically rootless, and finally, provoked to some catatonic reverie. And again, we are put back down deep, in a track ironically titled _Levedad_, which perfectly expresses Calvino's paradoxical celebration of lightness in the face of inconsolable weight... Syzygy continues in this pattern to its conclusion. But let's leave it to you to follow on your own.\n\n***III: The Lightness of Weight***\n\nThe fact that Dalt demands such a thorough transformation of your sense of time and texture in just 32 minutes is a testament to her production skills, as much as to the edgy Barcelona twilight in which the album was composed. For two months straight, Dalt worked alone in a restless flat, with little measure of time or sleep, suspended, as she was, in the magnetic field of the Barcelona Metro. (The magnetic field was so strong her electric bass would produce little more than intense buzzing; one practical reason for Syzygy's stylistic switch to synthesiser drones and anxiety-fraught arpeggios.) In this claustrophobia, she filled her endless twilight with the company of 20th century film ghosts. Classics by Clouzot, Godard, Antonioni, and Bergman played on a video projector, straight through the recording process. Dalt would allow the film's sudden changes of mood and tempo to push the music in new directions, as if these cinematic moments were simply stems in the mix.\n\nBut for this reason, Syzygy still advances by means of surprise and aesthetic delight. A purely abstract musical framing of her subject might result in a difficult listen, whereas Dalt offers up whirring, purring, squealing, episodic timbres that are fundamentally filmic.\n\n***IV: Inferno***\n\nIt is, in fact, Syzygy's compressed format that belies the album's multidimensionality; its fabric of conjunction/opposition invades the narrow space between medium and signification. The lyric sheet is populated (or de-populated, destabilized) by seemingly incongruous quotations and scrambled notations: Sudden changes of language. Distorted re-arrangements of Benjamin's powerful critique of alienation. Peter J. Carroll's politicized defense of schizophrenia. Calvino's touching defense of happiness. A line from a Spanish government email confirming Dalt's change of citizenship.\n\nThis gives the listener not just a read-along to the vocal tracks, but a hidden textual dimension.

Much further downstream, a giant wall of light scaffolding fades into view. That is destiny's orphan multiverse inhabiting a single frame in its infancy. In time, we would transcend it. From where we stand our footsteps recede and fade into the darkness. But our beginnings are not lost; for someone standing off and above our horizon, in a human ear much more young, the secret of our coming of age shall be preserved revealed and discovered yet once again....\"<br>—Ariel Pink, November 2012_</small>\n\nThrash and Burn dates from a time when Ariel Rosenberg, then a few years from turning \"Pink\", first proclaimed himself a \"20th Century Composer\", without a trace of irony in his voice. Appropriately, this early work takes the form of a musique concrète epic forged from Rosenberg's late-90's faux-primitif, garage-punk, and tape-loop experiments.\n\nAt 94 minutes and 36 tracks, Thrash and Burn displays the symphonic ambitions of his genre-devouring pop saga, Haunted Graffiti, but with little in the way of fastidious album-oriented constructions. Rather, Thrash and Burn is a free-form tape ramble that uses gauzy atmospherics to strike up a wicked dialogue with the likes of Rosenberg's non-pop influences, like Iannis Xenakis, Pierre Schaeffer and Luc Ferrari.\n\nThrash and Burn was discovered in 2005, in an ankle-deep pile of cracked cassettes and scratched CD-R's in Rosenberg's Beverly Hills flat. After an initial reconstruction attempt, Thrash and Burn became a 4-cassette box set for the inaugural release of Human Ear Music, in 2006.\n\nThrash and Burn was remastered in September 2012 in Berlin, Germany. The final master was brought up to 24 bit resolution, dynamically and tonally balanced.\n","as":"f481e010-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"thrash-burn.jpg","aw":"10","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","bc":"1","bf":"Ariel Pink — April 1, 2013","bg":"thrash-and-burn-ariel-pink-press-release","bj":"Thrash And Burn Press Release"},{"bl":"c4610153-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Tombstones reconstitutes the ghost of the voice.

Slipping down the inexorable mountain-slope of tones in \"New Orleans\", or bearing mute witness to the dark octaves that loom over Julia Holter's delicate vocal on \"Silent Cloud\", you get the feeling that Tombstones, like Pierre Klossowski's viscious spinning Baphomet, wants to draw all histories out into the open, and to make them speak.\n\n_**M**: \"The tombstones take tiny fragments of old and not-so-old songs and put them into an experimental music situation, introducing them to a kind of chaos, where the arrangement of the written out material is up for grabs.\"_\n\nThis presents an exhilarating challenge in a culture already saturated by hallucination, paradox, and shadowplay. Each \"tombstone\", as these tracks are called, is literally a \"sampled\" bit of structure, tuning, lyricism, beat or phrasing; a mystery moment sourced from perhaps, The Beatles, DJ Screw, Bob Dylan or UGK, to name a few. (The actual sources are a closely guarded secret, but in some cases not hard to guess.)\n\n_**M**: \"I selected performances with this question in mind: Did the song happen?\"_\n\nPisaro boils the archetype of sampling down to a fragment of intention, the groundwork of a sound, and ultimately, a cultural _technê_ at once beyond the reach, and at the origin of the act of editing. Or in other words, it's the knowledge-seeker's paradox in music: While it is not possible to know all there is in creation, it is quite possible to distill the elegant, simple processes at its heart. With this distillation, Pisaro attempts to freeze one curious tension after another, in which the voice (or the archetype of the voice) is shaken out of a field of interferences, and made to speak as if in song.\n\n_**M**: \"At least one singer and at least three instruments... Each chord (sustained) for itself with any amount of time between them ... an occasional, vaguely defined noise which occurs two or three times during the chords.\"_\n\nIn the band, electronics are conspicuously absent (but not forbidden). Two electric guitars (played by Grier and Pisaro) appear. Otherwise, Tombstones relies on a rather economical spread of acoustic instruments and percussion, some conventional, some not-so-conventional. The pulsating drones of harmonium (Tashi Wada, Julia Holter) and e-bow guitar anchor the field with unwavering strings (Cassia Streb, Laura Steenberge, Laena Myers-Ionita) and flute (Kelly Coats) performed without a hint of vibrato. Percussionist Rob Esler offers a surprising range of naturalistic (sometimes eerily synthsiser-like) performances that aim for halo more than punctuation.\n\nThe effect will be familiar to those who frequently listen to like-minded music whose focus is on unmediated experience of the subtlest timbres. However, in Tombstones' zoomed-in context, a double-image is generated: A face in lucidity and a face in suspense. Suspended, as it were, between exhilaration and anticipation, vocalists Janet Kim, Julia Holter, Laura Steenberge and Lisa Tolentino each approach their performances in unique ways.\n\nLisa Tolentino's performances in \"Blues Fall\" and \"A Better Way\" (which bookend the album) are perfectly nuanced between storytelling, and reverence for the delicate conditions in which her voice must carry only the memory of a narrative. In the former track, \"Blues Fall\", her confidence holds sway in the midst of a maelstrom of sound. Yet it's this very confidence that lends the ensemble its fearsome character. But as Janet Kim's plainspoken intonation descends well below its range in the similar droning mass of \"New Orleans\", you can't help but think of a very different situation in the face of the storm: frailty, surprise, and collapse.\n\nThis brings us to the very nature of Pisaro's composition technique, which preserves the experimental situation (one of probabilities, conditions and descriptions) within a realm of risk and wonder. In \"Fool\", we have the impossibly protracted dimensions of a single line from the hook to UGK's rap ballad \"One Day\" (we'll give you that one). But a closer look at the score reveals not an act of dissection, nor a state of chance, but a state of trust. The ensemble must feel out how long to make sound. They must choose on instinct, when to start and when to stop. Pisaro offers only just-so-many-notes, or just-so-few dynamic markings. It's like a blind descent. A release of mourning. A release from mourning. Again happy.","as":"f4820720-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"tombstones.jpg","aw":"8","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Michael Pisaro — June 19, 2012","bg":"tombstones-michael-pisaro-press-release","bj":"Tombstones Press Release","bk":"Tomb&shy;stones Press Release"},{"bl":"c4612866-42a9-11eb-a742-9f2c7117e4e5","ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"\"'Unbekannte' is a German word for the unknown, or unknown quantity.

It's an album about the precipice that brings life to\nnothingness and nothingness to life, only to leave certainty suspended in its orbit. In other words, this headless Baphomet: a\nrepeated journey from climax to climax in which noema and aporia are ever­entangled. Is an uncertain future just like a sky out of\norder? Or rather like a blessing from God? Is our inability to fully love related to our inability to take the measure of this world\nfully? Or is there an unwillingness to love; a stubbornness about devotion that cannot be likened to the incalculability of nature's\nfull extent?\"<br>\n– Jason Grier, 2013_</small>\n\n<small>_\"Grier begins this record singing a simple and sweet­voiced a cappella song promising nothing: \"Baby, I don't know right now\",\nleaving us curious. He, like Lucrecia Dalt, has spent a lot of time making more conventionally­formed solid songs, but here he goes\nfurther than he ever has from straight songwriting.  Almost every \"song\" on this record features one specific recording or field\nrecording that is explored for a while, with a strangely pleasing way of beginning soft and gentle, and growing more and more\nmysterious (maybe even frightening) as time progresses. As a whole, it's like a series of captivating and mysterious short films.\"\n– Julia Holter, 2013_</small>\n\nFor his first major studio album Jason Grier assembles a bewildering musical vocabulary acquired during his tenure as director of Human Ear Music. After working the better part of a decade as a curator moving freely between pop and experimental circles, Grier sought to put his curatorial ethos into a singular artistic statement. Within Unbekannte’s dense 35 minutes, allusions to Michael Pisaro, James Tenney, Alvin Lucier, Pan Sonic, Giancinto Scelsi, Phill Niblock, Jodeci, Woo, etc, are deployed in a sprawling post­studio framework.\n\n\"Unbekannte\" is German word which means \"unknown\", \"unknown person\", or in a mathematical context, \"variable\", or \"unknown quantity\". Appropriately, the album comprises a series of lyrical settings, assembled from a year of assiduous, yet decidedly aleatoric studio sessions. Grier would offer to his engineer, his band, and himself, little more direction than \"just play something melancholic while I put on this meditation record\", or \"what does it sound like to cut this wire here? then here! then here!!\" He commissioned hour­long cymbal solos, spun psychoacoustic tone­webs from thousands of guitar harmonics, used rewired guitar amps as sub­bass microphones, and recorded the spontaneous sizzling of snare drums placed in a sealed room beside bass oscillators set at extreme volume levels. Each session led to a uniquely gorgeous dead end, its purpose seeming to be the fabrication of an endless sequence of exotic sound objects. After a year of aimless experimentation, it looked as if a grand theme was nowhere to be found. It was the studio album reduced to the creation of a sample library. Likewise, it was the artist eerily struck from the act of creation just at the moment when he should be fully realized. But this was, in fact, Grier’s \"grand\" theme: to squint right back, with a half­smile, at pop music’s faustian promise to transform introspection into self­affirming sound objects. In the process of assembling this material into album format, Grier let all the sentimentality of lyric songwriting fall out of its own framework like fraying threads. Then he observed the variety of ways in which these threads decompose over time; into noise, into silence, into cancelled morphologies, into quivering amplitudes, into jolting textures. For Grier, uncertainty is not a point of collapse, but a point of departure, and a point of return. And as such, Unbekannte is a searching critique of the studio’s alchemical powers, as much as it is an ostentatious display of those powers.\n\nBut if Unbekannte is a challenging listen, that’s not just because of its extravagant, sometimes brutalist sonic pallette. Unbekannte’s real challenge is its wry exploration of the limits of certainty in love, identity, and ontology. Inspired by the concrete poetry of Helmut Heißenbüttel and Haroldo de Campos, Grier’s hyper­minimalist lyric style stretches terse, brutally ambivalent fragments of dialogue across an entire vocal track.\n\n***1***\n\n<small>_\"What if I could say for sure... if I can stay on the ground... if I can stay on my\nfeet... if you can believe in me... if I can save you the pain?\"_</small>\n\nThe opening track, \"Baby I Don’t Know Right Now\"  – an airless a capella, dry, no trace of reverb – is as harmonically rich as it is claustrophobic. The extended silences between verses disrupt and emphasize this track’s fragile identity, balanced as it is between heartbreaker and cold hard sound­object. Grier’s approach might imitate the romanticism of some Jodeci improv he once watched in his tweens, on an American late­night talk show in the 90’s. But the singer appropriated here is neither a heartbroken victim, nor a romantic hero, nor an emotional victimizer. The singer is simply the quintessential error­of­omission, the voice of all those moments of doubt when we can locate no proper answer to the question \"how does it feel to be you?\"\n\nThe next two tracks lay the groundwork for Grier’s treatment of sound. \"Der Wind und das Meer\" and \"The\nWidows\" are quasi­hymnic tableaux that build upon simple motifs (acoustic guitar and violin, respectively)\nuntil the layers become so detailed as to collapse into sensory overload. This is noise, not as a dialectical\ncounterpart to sensual order, but as a function of senses overwhelmed; detail to the point of unintelligibility.\nAnother way to put it: Grier is a minimalist, in his insistence that the materiality of sound must take\nprecedence over development and variation. But he is an expressionist, in that he entices his own\nsound­objects to collide, amplify, harmonize, overwhelm, and finally, rub themselves raw.\n\n\"Cover Me\", anchoring the album’s first half, is the ballad of a seducer who knows how much pleasure the\nobject of his/her desire can derive from the memory of a trampled heart. It begins with warm words enough,\nbut in the course of just three phrases, the song’s one line turns as cold and sinister as a winter alone. The\nblurred overtones of Telecasters and bass oscillators accompany this glacial unfolding of suspense,\nelation, paradox, climax and dénouement, as the listener is slowly exposed to the twists and turns of\nsentiment contained in a single sentence:\n\n<small>_\"Lie by my knees;<br>\nI can warm you<br>\nlike the thought of<br>\nthe lover you<br>\nhad yesterday<br>\nbent at your knees<br>\non the pavement.\"_</small>\n\nCover Me climaxes with a stygian chamber orchestra consisting of blown bassbins, ungrounded power lines, and crackling microphones, before collapsing gently into waves of bass­on­bass counterpoint between detuned guitars and turntables with their ground wires stripped out. \"Gravity Well\" creates aporia – attractive waves of silence – by allowing simple tones to make contact, and dissolve.\n\n\"My Love Knows No Fascism\" brings the album’s midpoint to an unusually psychedelic plateaux. This track\nis also unusual in its use of effects processing, which is otherwise almost entirely absent throughout\nUnbekannte. Tremolo­soaked guitars play a lazy afternoon riff harmonized by oscillators, bells and field\nrecordings sourced from a disintegrating relaxation record Grier found on a thrift­shopping expedition.\nAgainst this warm sunny backdrop, Grier whispers, in Spanish, a heartfelt, vexingly sweet assertion:\n\n<small>_\"My love without limit, that I can barely see.<br>\nYou cannot lie. You cannot be unjust.<br>\nInterminably, complicatedly, eternally, contrarily.\"_</small>\n\nIn other words, love can indeed embody justice, and vice versa, but only if it is infinitely ambivalent.\n\n***2***\n\nAfter collaborating in the past with Julia Holter and Nite Jewel, Grier considered a number of guest vocalists for \"Unbekannte\". But in the end he decided the album should contain only two voices: his own, and that of Spanish­Colombian singer Lucrecia Dalt. The resonance thus created is both archetypal and intensely autobiographical. (Grier and Dalt being recent immigrants to unknown territory in Berlin.) Yet their vocal performances are never dramatized. Rather, they hold steady over Unbekannte’s currents of noise, texture, harmony and drone. In this way, Unbekannte’s voices become alloyed in a quivering tension which builds even as it remains motionless. This tension finally overflows in the two­part \"Helen Of Troy\".\n\nUnbekannte’s most ambitious statement, \"Helen Of Troy\" brings the idea of unknowability into a psychosocial frame. It opens with the testimonial of a schizophrenic patient at Pitié­Salpêtrière in the mid­19th century, as recorded by François Leuret. (The German translation used here was famously quoted by Austrian experimental psychiatrist Leo Navratil, in his book \"Schizophrenie und Sprache\" in 1976.) It is the bizarre, and bizarrely skillful, testimonial of an alter­ego without origin. Not a hallucinated Other, nor a reconstituted Same, but a phantasm­like \"person of me\":\n\n<small>_\"The person of me is the child of no one. The origin of the person of me is<br>\nunknown. She has no memory of from whence she came. The woman of whom<br>\nyou speak is perhaps she for which one had made this dress.\"_</small>\n\nThe patient’s confession is recited in three times: Once in the dark vacuum of an earthshaking sub­bass chord, next, over an assault of sizzling snare drums, and finally, as introduction to the eerie calm of a long interval on clarinet. Afterward, the clarinet ensemble builds a lush fabric of tones slowly, amassing an organ­like block chord, only to find itself stuck at that moment in a digital loop. The vocalists then intone the hallucinatory dream of \"Helen\" – the embodiment of the point where psychological fragmentation and public schizophrenia meet:\n\n<small>_\"Ask me so, but unfortunately, I do not know whom you ask.<br>\nOught we come together with all the personalities<br>\nthat we with all Europe in this city thus created?<br>\nWho can tell Helen’s story? Try to ask me her old name.<br>\nDressmaker, sew miracles in this dress, just for me.<br>\nI’ll put it on, go out walking, take a walk, go to be all the people.\"_</small>\n\nAll the people in my head? Or all the people in the world? The lyrics make abrupt transitions from Spanish to German to English, to further the confusion of identity, nationality and speech. Eventually the vocals themselves become stuck in a catatonic nausea of some infinite delay. Except it becomes clear on a closer listen that the 37 repetitions of \"all the people\" were sung individually, not looped. With their tantric backing band, those words obtain a mantra­like persistence. They confess that we are unable to be all souls and to count all souls at the same time. The \"person of me\" is over­multiplied until she becomes the schizophrenia of a whole city – particularly Berlin, with its fragmented history, polymorphic array of languages, and dizzying social entanglements.\n\n***3***\n\nGrier then brings the album steadily to a close, traversing genre­space with an oddly­matched series of\ntableaux. Again, only a single, slowly unfolding, sentence is needed:\n\n<small>_\"In this fireplace,<br>\nin this burning heart,<br>\nall the thoughts that<br>\ncan’t get expressed yet<br>\nwill be there<br>\nto keep you warm,<br>\nto comfort your head,<br>\nin the winter.\"_</small>\n\nSounding like a shredded spaghetti­western atmosphere shrouded in the hum and hiss of a malfunctioning\nEMI limiter, \"¡Salud!\" is a last moment of reflection on the way to Unbekannte’s surprising conclusion.\nBefore the winter, before the unknown begs its question, the choir salutes:\n\n<small>_\"Salud, Salida!\"_</small>\n\n\"Cheers! Exit!\" Grier reminds us here not to leave anything behind. Because if we do, all we’ll have to keep\n\nus warm in the winter will be the thoughts we failed to express today. Cheers and goodbye. It’s time to embrace the future. Dalt returns once again for a lush, wordless chorale, backed by 808’s, vibraphones and rubbed stones. It’s a sentimental pause before a barrage of roaring cymbals comes in with a narrative charge that condenses Unbekannte’s sonic explorations into a single punctuation mark. Then \"Silent Betonung\" (\"Silent Emphasis\") – a dub jam carved in negative space from carefully selected slabs of distortion and feedback – is the accompaniment to the album’s final words:\n\n<small>_\"Y después, Y después, Y después...\"_</small>\n\n\"And then. And then. And then...\" Unbekannte’s final track is this plea’s voiceless answer. As finales go, it is beautifully indifferent, and unexpectedly simple. Hundreds of overdubbed sleigh bells ring out an even, unmodulated field of sparkling tones.\n\nA heaven of bells.","as":"f4825540-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"unbekannte.jpg","aw":"6","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":", done-for-now","az":true,"bc":"1","bf":"Jason Grier — December 17, 2013","bg":"unbekannte-jason-grier-press-release","bj":"Unbekannte Press Release","bk":"Unbe&shy;kannte Press Release"},{"ac":"Jason Grier","ah":"press-releases","ai":"April 2014","aj":"\n\n\"Whatever... at the Darkness of Night: \nThe HEM Compilation 2014\"\nInfos:\nFormats: LP (with download card), Digital\nRelease Date: 03.

This release also concludes a year of remastering and restoration work that began shortly after the label's european migration. It \ncombines tracks from previous HEM compilations dating back to 2006 with recordings from HEM concerts in 2009 and 2010. Lucrecia Dalt \ncontributes a previously-unreleased lock groove instrumental to conclude the album.\nSide A starts with 5 tracks from the first HEM compilation–a CD-R in handmade packaging–released in 2006. \"A very very fancy and exclusive \nsocial club,\" it was fabled to be, in the first press releases tipped by internet journals like Pitchfork and Tiny Mix Tapes. All hyperbole aside, \nHEM started, indeed, with a close-connected social group, one that included Ariel Pink, Nite Jewel and Julia Holter. They worked solo, and in \ncountless collaborative permutations, and were deeply indebted to the rising popularity of the home-recording aesthetic. But their take on it \nwas ever so tongue-in-cheek, such that the early HEM's combination of campy pomposity and sketchy nods to various pop genres have, over \nthe years, come across as mystifying (if not seriously off-putting) to many a reviewer... or as pure (human) genius to a few. Whatever \nconclusion is to be reached about HEM-circa-2006, the early tracks do represent a knowingly irreverent take on what would, in the 3 or 4 years \nto follow, become a genre that took itself rather more seriously: \"lo-fi\" pop.\nTracks like \"The Weird Wolf\" and \"Trance Parents\" fit this description perfectly. \"Trance Parents\" (a collaboration between Ariel Pink and \nGeneva Jacuzzi) with its relentless puns and in-jokes, snapshots a time when there were serious rumors of  the collective's plans to move to \nDubai: \"I say hello, you say Dubai.\" Yet tracks like Ry Rocklen's \"Under the Radar\", and John Maus' unabashedly devotional \"For Ariel Pink\" \nreveal that there can be a strange kind of candidness to this format. Even more candid–disarmingly so–is \"No Sweat\", from the wryly-named \nproject \"Holy Shit\". This track confronts the artist's destitution with a harried smirk that perhaps serves to remind us that to record on a \ngrungy 4-track might not always have been 100% a matter of style.\nOn the other hand, upward mobility might be best illustrated by the final track on Side A of this record. It is a live recording from HEM's 3-day \n\"Trauermusik\" festival in Los Angeles, the last before HEM would close shop in Los Angeles. Julia Holter croons an early version of \"Goddess \nEyes\", a song which would not just see a taste of wider exposure, but would undergo a few aesthetic upgrades to match. \"Goddess Eyes\" would \nmorph from this live loop-pedal version, to a softly home-produced track on Holter's breakthrough \"Tragedy\" LP a year later, only to see a \ntighter, more professional-sounding mix another year after that.\nSide B then takes the HEM story farther away from, but at the same time strangely closer to, home. The label first attracted spiritual \nforefathers (and mothers) in the form of brief engagements with the \"out\" pop musicians of the past, including Gary Wilson and Linda Perhacs. \n\nThis side begins with a live recording of Perhacs' \"Chimacum Rain\" from an HEM-organized event at the San Francisco Art Institute, held \nshortly after the label re-opened in 2010, for a year-long residency in San Francisco. Perhacs and then band-mate Holter accompanied each \nother through much of the set. In addition to this dive into the past, HEM began to find broader geographical horizons in its San Francisco days. \nTracks from (then) Oakland-based Jeepneys and (then) Brooklyn-based Laurel Halo appeared, respectively, on 7-inch and on HEM's 2010 \ncassette compilation. The delicate–and irresistibly named–collaboration between Holter and Nite Jewel, \"Nite Jewelia\", also appeared on the \n2010 cassette comp, and seemed an appropriate revisit to the home recording style of 2006. But by now, not only had HEM geographically \ndiversified, but it had pretty much become genre-agnostic. Indeed, while the early \"bedroom pop\" material could trade the transformation of \n(or the risking of) real naivety for the conceptual labor of insouciance, and while many artists' post/non-HEM projects ventured into serious \nmass appeal, HEM's active roster would gradually begin to fall back less and less on pop for conceptual redemption.\nThe eleventh track, Michael Pisaro's \"For Madison\", might be the perfect example of just what unites the early, insouciant years of HEM with \nits avant-leaning present. This track, in just a few minutes, stretches (or perhaps oversteps entirely) the tethers that separate field recording, \nsampling, appropriation art, modern composition, and pop music.\nA live performance of a work by John Cage follows in the next track, furthering HEM's web of connections and influences. In 2009, Cage's \n\"Songbooks\" was orchestrated by Jason Grier (HEM's continuing director and primary ideologue) for Michael Pisaro's \"Dog Star Orchestra\" \nfestival in Valencia, California. And it was, indeed, here, in Valencia, at the California Institute of the Arts, where Grier and Ariel Pink first met, \nand where Julia Holter and John Maus studied with Pisaro. In this Cage track, as in the Pisaro track that precedes it, pop music returns to HEM, \nto peer through the veil of the concept–through the window of John Cage's variable instrumentation–as some orchestra members chose \nwhole music recordings as their \"instrument\".\nThis album finishes with two artists from HEM's (present day) Berlin contingent, Ekkehard Ehlers and Lucrecia Dalt. Ehlers practices a similar \nkind of magic to Pisaro, only this time conjuring up avant garde music's Ursprung and reshuffling it into a post-glitch moodscape. It falls upon \nLucrecia Dalt to create her own compelling synthesis of HEM's pop past and its freeform present. Her work around this time begins to play \nincreasingly on the undecidable consequences of pinning states of song to states of mind, sometimes resulting in a blissful urgent verse, only \nto collapse into haunting, psychoacoustic minimalism. Her contribution ends this album with a lock groove, wavering on infinitely, defiantly, \nand mysteriously, much like the ongoing history of HEM.","as":"f4827c50-485e-11eb-a734-057291ab284f","av":"the-human-ear-volume-1.jpg","aw":"1","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bf":"Various Artists","bg":"whatever-various-artists-press-release","bj":"Whatever Press Release"},{"ac":"Jason Grier","ah":"press-releases","ai":"April 2014","aj":"\n\nHEM\nHEM | Human Ear Music – www.humanearmusic.de\nThis first vinyl pressing of The HEM Compilation tracks the label from its beginning as a \ncollective of home-recording enthusiasts living no more than one degree of separation \nfrom each other in the shadow of Hollywood, to its present form as a conceptual music \nlabel based in Berlin.

PACKS\n\n#### Noise Reduction Artifacts\n\nTwelve unique keyboard instruments made from frequencies removed by an industry-standard audio restoration plugin while cleaning up a noisy field recording.\n\n#### Election Protest\n\nThis is a recording of post-election protests following the 2016 US presidential election. It was recorded on a laptop in Berlin, from a live video stream. Due to a terrible internet connection, the audio is jagged and choppy; riddled with dropouts, time-shifts, and sandblasted textures. The association to noise and ambient genres is unavoidable. But the emergence of recognisable chants like \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" from the fog of glitches insists that this \"soundscape\" isn't a matter of genre, but the labor of sounding bodies in a crucial historical moment.\n\n#### New Year's Eve, Berlin Kreuzberg\n\nBerlin's Kreuzberg borough is famous for getting blanketed with fireworks and explosives —legal, quasi-legal, and otherwise— every year around midnight on December 31st. The bombs fly every which way (not just up) to create an immersive experience, to say the least. This pack captures the experience in 2016 and 2017. One, from a high vantage point on a 9th floor balcony overlooking Kottbusser Tor; the other, from Orannienstraße, down on the street.\n\n#### Destroyed Piano\n\nReplica of a rare, 130-year-old, \"pyramid\" piano found in a state of extreme disrepair in a hilltop villa in Tuscany. Each individual key possesses its own surprising timbre. The sound is reminiscent of prepared piano, but this instrument was merely \"prepared\" by time and age.\n\n#### Sax\n\nA chorus of windswept whispers, humid chants overblown through the reeds, gasping dramatic personae, illegible pleading voices, and a frenzied percussion ensemble. This set of saxophone-space explorations showcases what can be done with the instrument in a textural mode beyond the melodic sphere. A frenetic homage to the classic avant-garde, as well as visceral modern drone.\n\n#### Runout Grooves\n\nLoops of vinyl LP's and 45's with the needle stuck bouncing against the center label. Suspenseful, trance-inducing, and rhythmic, these loops are also strange counterparts to the musics pressed on the very same records: Babyfather, Edith Piaf, Missy Elliot, Bernard Parmegiani, Culture Club, some weird ancient _Schlager_, and so on. Also includes a sampler instrument for keyboard play. An ongoing collection so check back for updates.\n\n#### Ducking Artifacts\n\nA collection of audio edits removed from several studio vocal sessions in the process of making \"pristine\" pop vocal tracks. The sounds consist of vocalists taking breaths —shallow, deep, hurried, long— between words and phrases, in anticipation of the next verse. Though these sounds are the discarded remnants of the process of making pop music, they have an intimacy all their own: Traces of the laboring body that are both unnerving and sensual.\n\n#### Studio Detritus\n\nAn extensive set telling tales of breakage, dilapidation, and decay in the studio: Crumbling insulation flapping in the wind, fraying patch cords and sparking tarnished switches, leftover concrete blocks scraping, buzzing monitors and hissing compressors, an ungrounded turntable and a squeaking live room door. An unusual percussion ensemble which bears the constant reminder of the materiality of our tools, and the unstoppable opposition of entropy to sonic perfection.\n\n#### Bendir, Darbuka, Flower Pot\n\nA chill home session with some amazing finger drumming on two rich and velvety Turkish drums and a flowerpot half-filled with water. Single hits, rolls, and some blistering polyrhythmic finger-drumming loaded up into a custom instrument that can produce massive ensemble sound or even spectral drones.\n\n#### Vintage Field Recording\n\nCrate-digging and field recording collide in a cloud of distressed vinyl and natural grandeur in this pack sampled from an early 1980's \"new age\" label's promotional vinyl LP. Pops, clicks, and vinyl distortion add a rich patina to the sounds of bubbling rivers, howling coyotes, roiling surf, and desert winds. Originally intended to beam thoughts of relaxation, therapy, tranquility, and self-realisation to the listener, these musty old recordings now take on a whole new layer questioning.\n\n#### Cymbal Workouts\n\nAn expressive round of all the cymbals in the kit. Fiery crescendi, suspenseful rolls, sharp and resonant finales, deep growling drones played with a viola bow. A huge variety of subtle moods from just two simple techniques.\n\n#### Condenser Mic Squeals\n\nA lush, haunting palette of sound derived from uncontrolled mic feedback. Arranged into a playable, pitched, keyboard instrument, this stereotypically forbidden sound evokes vast nightscapes, ghostly vocalisations, meditative drones, and rumbling bass. All from that dreaded ear-piercing squeal.","bl":"484b3bc0-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","ag":"SL2 is a significant update to some of the best of the original SL1 packs.

What happened to it? Where did it go? Unlike chemical waste, this audio waste probably just got deleted. Because it can just be deleted. But what if we held on to it?","ah":"articles","ai":"17.09.2020","aj":"Some mirrored histories:\n\nIn 1968, Danish composer Per Nørgård premiered \"Voyage into the Golden Screen\", considered by some to be the first proper piece of spectralist music.\n\nIn 1979, Hugues Dufourt formalised the spectralist movement, defining spectralism as music which deals, not with timbre, tone, and rhythm, but with frequency as a graph over time; a _visual_ thing that can be edited, displaced, redrawn, erased or excised.\n\nIn 1989, Fraunhofer-Gesellshaft received a patent in Germany for the MP3. Emerging from a teeming pack of prototypal \"psychoacoustic modelling\" algorithms, the MP3 codec became the standard means of excising spectral components from sound to yield more portable digital files. Similar spectral (FFT) approaches yielded algorithms to reduce noise, transients, clicks, pops, hums, and other audio gunk from digital recordings.\n\nThe evolution of the spectral consciousness of sound from a bold aesthetic move to a clinical means of filtering and compressing audio should come as no surprise from an engineering point of view. But from an artistic standpoint it's somewhat surprising that what once was a force of creation is now an agent of excision, compression; the decreative force of aporia.\n\nAs it is with the utopian projects that once promised to create a new world by means of heavy industry...\n\n~\n\nIn November 1986, 20 tons of toxic red-coloured extinguishing foam was dumped into the Rhine.\n\nIn April 2014, the City of flint, Michigan decided to switch its water source from Detroit's water system back to the Flint River. After decades of industrial pollution and failed cleanup attempts, the river retains high levels of chlorides. These chlorides erode plumbing, causing toxic sediments to leech into the water delivered to local homes for drinking, cooking, washing, and gardening; overwhelmingly affecting black and brown people.\n\nOn the 3rd of June, 2020, near the city of Norilsk in Siberia, 20,000 tons of diesel leaked into the Ambarnaya river. The water is clouded and red, with bizarre overtones of ochre and violet. It would be a mystifying body of water from a whole other world, if it weren't so damn deadly.\n\nThe cleanup of disaster zones like these can take decades, if total cleanup can be achieved at all. As with the Flint River, byproducts can remain in the water long after the primary pollutants have been successfully extracted. Furthermore, if the toxic materials are successfully removed, something must be done with them. Can they be broken down into innocuous substances? Contained safely underground or above ground in drums? Made useful again in other industries? etc.\n\n~\n\nHere, too, we are cleaning up a river.\n\nIt is a river recorded in 1977 and pressed onto vinyl for a corny series of \"natural soundscapes\" marketed to a pop audience. The LP, having rotted away in a San Francisco second-hand store for god-knows-how-long, is not in the best condition. The audio is clouded and distorted; the vinyl clicking and popping, the equalisation is shot to hell, and the dynamics are flat and lifeless.\n\nThis audio needs cleanup.\n\nFor this, we'll use an algorithm very much like the MP3, an algorithm born from the bloodline of spectralist music, an algorithm embedded in a plugin widely used in the music industry on a daily basis for audio restoration, clarification of field recordings, and correction of flawed studio takes. (To avoid commercialisation, we'll not mention the name of this plugin.) We pipe the audio to our plugin, choose some equalisation settings, use a spectral window to create a fingerprint of the undesirable noises, click \"render\", and... bam!\n\nWe have successfully cleaned up this river.\n\nIf only it were so simple in Flint, in Norilsk, in so many other real rivers around the globe. But our audio work can bear upon our understanding of such places. How we treat sound can be representative of how we treat nature and communities. Sound is in nature; is nature, after all.\n\n~\n\nSo now we have a pristine (recording of a) river. But what we're interested in is not the results of our cleanup, rather the byproducts of our cleanup. We're interested in the \"audio toxic waste\" and what can and should be done with it. What happened to it? Where did it go? Unlike chemical waste, this audio waste probably just got deleted. Because it can just be deleted. But what if we held on to it? Allowed it to persist the way chemical waste persists? What can we do about it? What can we do with it? What can it do with us?\n\nIf spectral cleanup is the removal of portions of a visual representation of a sound, then are the removed frequencies a kind of mirror image of the world we desired to get by doing cleanup? Is this mirror image also a world? Does it contain a tonal system? Do the sounds hold any aesthetic or critical interest? Can they be put to use in compositions? Sampled and _played_ on a drum pad? Can one find oneself at play in toxic waste?\n\nIn both the case of a river and of the recording of a river, the goal of a cleanup is to _make it as if the accident never happened_; even though it did. As the bizarre site in which toxicity thrived –red, ochre, violet, otherworldly– is relegated to memory, so is the ruinous mindlessness of contingency condemned to the desiccation of amnesia. In other words, how we got here is forgotten.\n\nSo in audio terms —again, letting how we treat sound be representative of how we treat nature and community— it must be useful, crucial even, to rehydrate the memory of this contingency, embodied in waste, and to play this waste like an instrument of its own, from a world of its own.\n\nrehydrate the memory of this contingency, embodied in waste, and to play this waste like an instrument of its own, from a world of its own.","bs":"0","ap":"0","aq":"10","as":"484aed57-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"track-placeholder-image.jpg","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bg":"mirror-world-sound-world-1","bi":"sound-library, ecomusicology, post-studio, psychoacoustics, embedded-essay","bj":"Mirror World Sound World"},{"ag":"HEM SL's Destroyed Piano pack holds a mirror up to avant-gardism's inverted projection of history as a product of heroic innovation, replacing an avatar of intentionality with a mute archaeological specimen.","ah":"articles","ai":"17.09.2020","aj":"_\"There's just something about music that always seems to come out of looking backward.\"\n—Morton Feldman_\n\nThough people sticking things into a piano to change its sound doesn't have a definitive origin, the practice is seen as having come to maturity with John Cage's dance score \"Bacchanale\", in 1938.\n\nUnlike Henry Cowell or Heitor Villa-Lobos, Cage's motivations may have been more a mix of monetary/pragmatic, than timbral/interventional. There simply wasn't the budget to hire a vast percussion ensemble. But with the right combination of screws, nails, paperclips and various other knickknacks, one could have an instant, cheap Gamelan playable by a single pair of hands.\n\nIn spite of its pragmatic origin, the prepared piano has by now become a mainstay of new music and new-music-adjacent styles —from Nils Frahm to Magda Mayas to Aphex Twin. Prepared piano is seemingly the prime signifier and avatar of avant-gardism. It seems like junk inserted into a grand piano's strings will never cease to thrill audiences, to allude to bold statements about class struggle, to signify the \"limits of genre\", and to evoke thoughts of risk, danger, adventurousness, and eclecticism. Terms like \"reinventing the piano\" are still used in press releases, and IRCAM even offers a meticulous replica prepared piano for computer-based musicians.\n\nHEM's \"Destroyed Piano\" is also a replica prepared piano of sorts. It's a snapshot of a 130 year-old instrument that was found rotting away in the dining hall of a fancy villa in northern Italy. It appeared to not have been serviced in decades, and to currently serve as more of a conversation piece. (Its odd, wedge-shaped design put it somewhere between an upright piano and a grand piano.) Its insides covered in mold and rust, this piano was more of an archaeological specimen than an instrument. But it was still somewhat playable.\n\nIn fact, what's perplexing about this ancient instrument –call it an artifact– is that it _sounds just like a prepared piano, though nobody prepared it_. Slack strings and rotten hammers missing their targets result in a sound that's uncannily similar to Cage's original specification of a timbrally vast, compact percussion ensemble. When played with eyes closed, one can nearly hear the Destroyed Piano reproducing the stylish agenda of rebellious intervention into the effete protocol of a pristine concert grand.\n\nIn its own small way Destroyed Piano may actually return the prepared piano to its Cagean origins: A found sound, a free sound, a sound free of intentionality. The artifact's risky/edgy/adventurous sound is the product of no sound design strategy, no political agenda, no curatorial programme, but rather of time. Decay and disrepair produced a piano that sounds just this way at just this moment, and which will continue to sound different until it finally turns to dust.\n\nDestroyed Piano holds a mirror up to avant-gardism's inverted projection of history as a product of heroic innovation, replacing an avatar of intentionality with a mute archaeological specimen.\n","bs":"0","ap":"0","aq":"10","as":"484aed56-3893-11eb-9b19-d773ba798561","av":"track-placeholder-image.jpg","bu":"hem.rocks","bc":"1","bg":"sonic-archaeology-and-sonic-intentionality-2","bi":"sound-library, forensics","bj":"Sonic Archaeology and Sonic Intentionality"},{"ah":"program","as":"065b9530-6d3d-11eb-87d4-657f1cdccd14","aw":"3","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bg":"annie-garlid-ucc-harlo","bi":"send-invite-soon","bj":"Annie Gårlid (UCC Harlo)","bm":"Articles"},{"ah":"program","ai":"June 2021","as":"44aecfe0-6523-11eb-89d9-8b757e15292b","aw":"4","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bg":"ucc-harlo","bi":"send-invite-soon","bj":"UCC Harlo","bm":"Tracks"},{"ah":"program","ai":"July 2021","as":"823f4f60-6523-11eb-96d8-5d8fc77a127f","aw":"5","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bg":"ucc-harlo-1","bi":"send-invite-soon","bj":"UCC Harlo","bm":"Mixes"},{"ah":"site-texts","aj":"## UNCONVENTIONAL\n\n<img src=\"{{ assetHost }}/hem.rocks/content/images/key-art/destroyed-piano.jpg\">\n\nSL2's sound design ethos is rooted in acousmatics, found sound, sonic detritus, extended technique, documentary, and audio forensics!\n\n## PLAYABLE\n\n<img src=\"{{ assetHost }}/hem.rocks/content/images/key-art/sl2-anim-bw.gif\">\n\nSL2 packs are meant to be _played_, with full keyboard spreads, dynamics control, and tactile parameters.\n\n## CRITICAL\n\n<img src=\"{{ assetHost }}/hem.rocks/content/images/key-art/scrolling-article.gif\">\n\nEach SL2 pack is sourced from sounds chosen for more than just design concerns, like ecomusicology, labor, activism, artistic research.\n","as":"93eee2a2-cbd1-43f4-9a0e-515d525c686a","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bg":"sl2-bullet-points","bj":"SL2 Bullet Points"},{"ac":"Jason Grier","ag":"Though more commonly used to make text comparisons, the magical Levenshtein distance can be used on images too!

about this hard-to-explain octopus of a project, which 4 years later seems much more light, sensual, and concrete than it once did","ah":"general-content","aj":"Demonstration Disc brought up this question of whether or not a work of art could be seen only as a labor horizon. I spent more than a year cutting and splicing audio samples in lieu of making any progress on an actual album. At the time this repetitive, wheel-spinning activity I truly felt was an activism or a vigil against (or at least a recalcitrant kind of procrastination of) the \"album cycle\". In doing it, I set up the work to be a kind of _labor performance_. In terms of getting one's self to the \"Artwork X by Artist Y\" stage and releasing something to the world, my sisyphean task was simply an endless never-becoming.\n\nToo, lurking within this question were the implications that labor and performativity were overlapping somehow, and that the artwork itself was in some way the very effacement of the _art labor_ which gave it life.\n\nIn the former case I could truly say that this was a labor performance cause my day job was the actual work I was doing —and _had_ to do— for money. And the main symptom I got from living through this scission between _performed labor and labor performed_ was this heightened awareness (hatred, if it's not too strong a word) of the obligatory nature of the day job versus this heightened awareness (again, hatred, if it's not too strong a word) of the complicity of art in its own self-fetishisation via the reification of the invisibility of labor. The two hatreds were kind of dissonant and kind of not, and their various points of friction kept my interest level high.\n\nIn the latter case, it was as if the polish and sheen of the final product —and the praise and admiration reflected back upon the final product's author— instantly wiped out the history of toil and hardship suffered in getting to that point. Even though they shared one and the same body, in place of the art laborer came the ✨Artiste✨ whose golden glow _authorised_ the artwork to perform its mythologizing/sanitizing operations on the whole architecture of despair that was its engendering. But I now see how both being the laborer and being the author are key narrative movements in the formation of identity (not just in the creative sphere but in the whole psychological/sociopolitical sphere), so in my own way, I see now that I was trying to find out how to make these two narratives to overlay, rather than annihilate one another.\n\nFour years later I ask these questions in slightly modulated ways. On the one hand I see this project with a deeper perspicacity, as it is clear to me that concerns of identity and gender are more central to the thoughts \"labor performance\" and \"artistic labor\", respectively, than they seemed to me at the time; no mere lurkers, but rather more like avatars. In this way, the work is much less abstract and \"conceptual\" than I naively thought it to be.\n\nOn the other hand I see the project with more nuance, sensuality, and lightness than before. Maybe the key to this is in my poker-faced insistence that the album is merely a \"user guide\" for the Sound Library, which was where all this cutting and splicing wound up in the end. This joke is so easy to see through, considering the album is clearly thematic and emotive and sonically... sinewy... (at least to most people I've talked to). But I'm sticking to this joke to an, itself, hilarious extent; putting sound packs up on Github, dispassionately offering stuff for download as music tools, using numbers as track titles, etc. Add to that the blundering progress of this robot, Seurat, which I built to endlessly cook up potential song ideas using the library sounds, and then serve them up as a soundtrack to my _real_ work day in startup land. Many twists and turns.\n\nOne reviewer commented that The Disc was like what noise music sounded like to a control freak. Which again, in retrospect, was the best review of all, because it completed the project's _reductio ad absurdum_ in a way that I never could. However, something that bugged me all this time was the album's length. It was vinyl vanity again, basing the work's running time on whether or not it could fit on a 12-inch LP. But to make it any longer, to indulge the sounds and go deeper into them, to make them out to be creatures which \"deserve\" some kind of proper caress,  might be to let some semblance of sentimentality through, to lose control freakiness and just be freaky, so to speak.\n\nStill, I find myself planning out a \"deluxe, not time-boxed edition\" now and then, and maybe that's going to happen this year. And it is true that my live set contains a lot of the sounds on Demonstration Disc, and often goes for several hours. So maybe that's the proper length for The Disc... Or maybe someone will pick up on the possibility that all the \"example sounds\" on the new HEM website _are_ in effect, \"Demonstration Disc II\".\n\n","as":"22cbe05e-af56-4841-8b89-a6786564b2b4","aw":"blog:1","bu":"jag.rip","az":true,"bg":"demonstration-disc-4-years-later","bi":"blog","bj":"Demonstration Disc, 4 Years Later"},{"ag":"I focus on small to medium-sized projects for small businesses and individuals, especially nonprofits, artists, musicians, and cultural institutions.","ah":"site-texts","aj":"# Bespoke Web Developer\n\n<nav>\n  <a href=\"#about-US\">About US</a>\n  <a href=\"#cultural-activities\">Cultural activities</a>\n  <a href=\"#experience\">Experience</a>\n  <a href=\"#my-tech\">My tech</a>\n  <a href=\"#pricing\">Pricing</a>\n  <a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a>\n</nav>\n\n## Hello!\n\nI'm Jason, an enterprise web developer who is now focusing on **small-to-medium projects for small businesses and individuals**; especially **nonprofits, cultural institutions, and artists**.\n\nI'm an artist myself, and I've also been running my own music label for over a decade.

Read more about it at esteemed software company Ableton's website:\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ableton.com/en/blog/jason-grier-demonstration-disc/\" target=\"_blank\">\n  <img src=\"{{ assetHost }}/jag.rip/content/images/inline/grier-ableton.png\">\n</a>\n\nI've also recently coded for a desktop app and online poetry journal which is currently getting a good amount of attention for its second edition.

I had just developed a fresh new custom Javascript framework called **\"Pompom\"** and my architecture was put to the test and proven with a successful deployment for Amazon.\n\n### Billy (DK)\n\nFor two years, I was a senior developer at **Billy.dk**, one of Scandinavia's must successful and user-friendly online bookkeeping services. My big project there was to strategize a way to migrate them off of their aging Ember architecture and onto **React**.\n\n### Moneyflow (DK)\n\nMy most recent and beloved position. In addition to their warm and welcoming team, my adventure with **Moneyflow** has included the thrill of helping to grow one of Scandinavia's fastest up-and-coming FinTech's, and the challenge of strategizing a modern Javascript solution to go on top of a solid Python backend.\n\n### Facebook (US)\n\nWhen back in my home land of the United States, I had the good luck to be assigned some lead development work for **Facebook**, for a digital advertising agency that I worked for in San Francisco. I pulled a 48-hour shift building out a suite of b2b landing pages. It was well worth the experience.\n\n### Charter Cable (US)\n\nAt this same San Francisco agency I also had the opportunity to run point on a major overhaul of one of the nation's (then) cable TV giants. Most cherished achievement here was to steer the overall UI direction, while also building some sophisticated application features, like a dynamic retail outlet finder.\n\n***\n## My tech <a id=\"my-tech\"></a>\n\nThat aforementioned Javascript framework called \"Pompom\" was based on React and Typescript. I've since moved on to develop an even more super-powered framework called \"Mono\" that includes mass multitenancy (whitelabelling), secure content management, Node and PHP-based API's, and the ability to deploy desktop apps.\n\nI can architect your solution in whatever way works best for you. Maybe you'd rather WordPress than my custom CMS? No problem! Maybe you'd like Vanilla Javascript rather than React? Fine by me. I'm flexible and unopinionated.\n\n***\n## Pricing <a id=\"pricing\"></a>\n\nTotally flexible. Let me know what your budget is and I will let you know what I can do that will be a great result, and *well* within your budget. What I'm listing here is just a general guideline:\n\n- Single page — 500\n- 5-page portfolio — 1000\n- Institution/Organization main site — 10k\n- Magazine site — 20k\n\n***\n## Conclusion <a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n\nOk that's all I have for now.<br>\nI look forward to getting to know you, just reach out!\n\n{{ Component:ContactForm }}\n\nThanks for

In the form of a Catholic mass, avant-garde, post-bop, and devotional motifs are carefully arranged to move the listener through an epic narrative about the legend of St Martin de Porres.","as":"59ebbaa7-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":"exhibit-frames","az":true,"bg":"the-catalogue-as-a-work-of-art-frame-8","bj":"The Catalogue As A Work Of Art Frame 8"},{"ah":"site-texts","ai":"April 2021","aj":"<h2>Catalogue and<br />spirit</h2>\n\nAgnes Martin described her series \"On a Clear Day\" as shift from joy to happiness. The 30 meticulous prints of subtle grids produces a monumental sense of contemplation. But unlike her previous works, which exemplify \"joy\", ecstasy and elation, \"On a Clear Day\" represents a state where the sublime becomes routine; suffuses all of one's days in the form of happiness.\n\nThis subtle but powerful distinction between joy and happiness is perhaps where the catalogue-as-artwork finds its inner self. The sense of the peacefulness of regularity excited by careful inspection of variety within the subtle, combined with the expansiveness of the experience of the grander study.","as":"59ebbaa8-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":"exhibit-frames","az":true,"bg":"the-catalogue-as-a-work-of-art-frame-9","bj":"The Catalogue As A Work Of Art Frame 9"},{"ah":"site-texts","ai":"April 2021","aj":"<h2>Catalogue and<br />utility</h2>\n\nIn 2018, Australian collective Utility produced a collection of bespoke arpeggios for electronic music producers and DJ's.

Utility demonstrates that an archive of banal presets can be animated within and as a creative framework of its own.\n","as":"59ebbaa9-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b","bu":"hem.rocks","bv":"exhibit-frames","az":true,"bg":"the-catalogue-as-a-work-of-art-frame-10","bj":"The Catalogue As A Work Of Art Frame 10"},{"bl":"59ebbaa0-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa1-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa2-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa3-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa4-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa5-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa6-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa7-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa8-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n59ebbaa9-81a5-11eb-a945-bf6f834db58b\n7fe41450-790b-4d98-97d3-66e64505b54b\na4adde0d-1fa7-4561-95af-3ff47114897c","ah":"exhibits","as":"dcac9b8a-6f2b-4327-a517-c7e90da1e865","av":"the-catalogue-as-a-work-of-art-exhibit.jpg","aw":"6","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bg":"the-catalogue-as-a-work-of-art-exhibit","bi":"new","bj":"The Catalogue as a Work of Art"},{"ac":"Julia Holter","ag":"HEM's first NFT edition is an early work by Julia Holter; a mapping of John Cage's \"Roratorio\" over a Raymond Chandler-esque downtown landscape","ah":"editions","ai":"April 2021","as":"f05bad12-bd6a-4787-846f-fb62a2e8fc0d","av":"cookbook.png","aw":"2","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bc":"1","bg":"cookbook-nft-edition","bi":"featured","bj":"Cookbook NFT Edition"},{"ah":"notes","aj":"# HEM Staff Candidates\n\n## Nominating Directors\nJason Grier\nLine Dyrholm\n\n## Nominated Directors\nRamona Gonzales\nJulia Holter\nGary Schultz\nMichael Pisaro\n\n## Curators\n\nScott Cazan\nAdee Robertson\nAnna Luisa Petrisko\nEvelyn Malinowski\n\nJana Pappenbroock\n","as":"579968d4-b279-4ffa-8cab-66d98539e193","bu":"hem.rocks","az":true,"bg":"staff-nominees","bj":"Staff Nominees"},{"ah":"program","as":"24f0c800-827b-11eb-b231-35759921de15","aw":"0","az":true,"bg":"claire-rousay","bi":"wish-list","bj":"Claire Rousay","bm":"Editions"},{"ah":"site-texts","ai":"April 2021","aj":"<h2>Catalogue and<br />quilting</h2>\n\nThe HEM Sound Library (produced by Jason Grier from 2017 to the present) is a sweeping take on sonic, artistic, and perceptual labor.

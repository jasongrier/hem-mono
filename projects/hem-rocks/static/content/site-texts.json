I had just developed a fresh new custom Javascript framework called **\"Pompom\"** and my architecture was put to the test and proven with a successful deployment for Amazon.\n\n### Billy (DK)\n\nFor two years, I was a senior developer at **Billy.dk**, one of Scandinavia's must successful and user-friendly online bookkeeping services. My big project there was to strategize a way to migrate them off of their aging Ember architecture and onto **React**.\n\n### Moneyflow (DK)\n\nMy most recent and beloved position. In addition to their warm and welcoming team, my adventure with **Moneyflow** has included the thrill of helping to grow one of Scandinavia's fastest up-and-coming FinTech's, and the challenge of strategizing a modern Javascript solution to go on top of a solid Python backend.\n\n### Facebook (US)\n\nWhen back in my home land of the United States, I had the good luck to be assigned some lead development work for **Facebook**, for a digital advertising agency that I worked for in San Francisco. I pulled a 48-hour shift building out a suite of b2b landing pages. It was well worth the experience.\n\n### Charter Cable (US)\n\nAt this same San Francisco agency I also had the opportunity to run point on a major overhaul of one of the nation's (then) cable TV giants. Most cherished achievement here was to steer the overall UI direction, while also building some sophisticated application features, like a dynamic retail outlet finder.\n\n***\n## My tech <a id=\"my-tech\"></a>\n\nThat aforementioned Javascript framework called \"Pompom\" was based on React and Typescript. I've since moved on to develop an even more super-powered framework called \"Mono\" that includes mass multitenancy (whitelabelling), secure content management, Node and PHP-based API's, and the ability to deploy desktop apps.\n\nI can architect your solution in whatever way works best for you. Maybe you'd rather WordPress than my custom CMS? No problem! Maybe you'd like Vanilla Javascript rather than React? Fine by me. I'm flexible and unopinionated.\n\n***\n## Pricing <a id=\"pricing\"></a>\n\nTotally flexible. Let me know what your budget is and I will let you know what I can do that will be a great result, and *well* within your budget. What I'm listing here is just a general guideline:\n\n- Single page — 500\n- 5-page portfolio — 1000\n- Institution/Organization main site — 10k\n- Magazine site — 20k\n\n***\n## Conclusion <a id=\"conclusion\"></a>\n\nOk that's all I have for now.<br>\nI look forward to getting to know you, just reach out!\n\n{{ Component:ContactForm }}\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nBest,<br>\nJ<br>\nj@hem.rocks<br>\n+49 (0)176 32 59 59 19\n\n\n\n\n\n","as":"353a8233-7926-4bfa-a858-36d09c357da8","bu":"jag.rip","az":true,"bg":"bespoke-web-developer","bj":"Bespoke Web Developer"},{"ah":"site-texts","ai":"April 2021","aj":"<h1>\nThe Catalogue<br />\nas a<br />\nWork of Art\n</h1>\n\nWhat happens when the very process of creating a catalogue is, itself, a mode of artistic practice?

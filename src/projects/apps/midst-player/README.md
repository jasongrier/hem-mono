# Midst

__Play Midst files on a website__

Essentially, this project folder is just an alternate entry point for the Midst build. It's mainly to keep the app internals off a public web page, but also to make the web page lighter. Only the `TimelineButtons` component is custom. The other parts are cherry picked from `../midst`

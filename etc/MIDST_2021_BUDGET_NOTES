What we ask—A total itemized budget for your project proposal.

Why we ask it—This gives us an honest sense of how much it will take to make the project happen, including reasonable fees for the artists involved. It is also a window into the scale of the project and if you have a reasonable understanding of what it will take to execute it. Think of this as another way to tell the story of the proposed project. It’s important to understand that this is just an estimate, and that the budget is subject to change. We also recognize that this budget may well exceed what the Creative Capital Award is worth. Make sure to always pay yourself and active partners!

the main thing is that, unlike our prior applications, we’re not really going to hedge at all about what we’ve done or what we want to do. we’re going to be really clear about what we’ve accomplished so far — beta app, initial site — and what we want to accomplish — a robust multiplatform publicly-available app, and a site that acts as an open-access social platform for sharing process (including ppl creating accounts/profiles at midst & uploading their own work).

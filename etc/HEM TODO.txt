# About HEM

HEM (Human Ear Music) was once a record label founded in 2006 in Los Angeles, then moved to San Francisco, Berlin, Copenhagen, and Austin Texas. In 2020 HEM passed on the mantle to HEM (Hot Extra-musicality) and is currently world-based and focussing on extended practices in sound and software politics. Part utilitarian and part communitarian. Persistently weird.

# About the Comp

As inclusive as imaginable. No limit on track length.

# Parallel Activities

Software releases, sample packs, articles, a live streaming venue. Check the preview website here.

# Terms

Lazy-loaded, chunked content.json (maybe one for tracks and then one per page)

Audit for missing stuff and fill it in below

Missing SL tracks:
– Almost all of them

Entire playlist item should start playback and change bg color. This should be done with CSS or with a functionality upgrade to the TrackPlayPauseButton component
